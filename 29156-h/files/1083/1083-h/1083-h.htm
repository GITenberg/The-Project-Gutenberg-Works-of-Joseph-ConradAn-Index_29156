<h2>FIRST NOTE</h2>
<p>The pages which follow have been extracted from a pile of
manuscript which was apparently meant for the eye of one woman
only.&nbsp; She seems to have been the writer&rsquo;s
childhood&rsquo;s friend.&nbsp; They had parted as children, or
very little more than children.&nbsp; Years passed.&nbsp; Then
something recalled to the woman the companion of her young days
and she wrote to him: &ldquo;I have been hearing of you
lately.&nbsp; I know where life has brought you.&nbsp; You
certainly selected your own road.&nbsp; But to us, left behind,
it always looked as if you had struck out into a pathless
desert.&nbsp; We always regarded you as a person that must be
given up for lost.&nbsp; But you have turned up again; and though
we may never see each other, my memory welcomes you and I confess
to you I should like to know the incidents on the road which has
led you to where you are now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he answers her: &ldquo;I believe you are the only one now
alive who remembers me as a child.&nbsp; I have heard of you from
time to time, but I wonder what sort of person you are now.&nbsp;
Perhaps if I did know I wouldn&rsquo;t dare put pen to
paper.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; I only remember that
we were great chums.&nbsp; In fact, I chummed with you even more
than with your brothers.&nbsp; But I am like the pigeon that went
away in the fable of the Two Pigeons.&nbsp; If I once start to
tell you I would want you to feel that you have been there
yourself.&nbsp; I may overtax your patience with the story of my
life so different from yours, not only in all the facts but
altogether in spirit.&nbsp; You may not understand.&nbsp; You may
even be shocked.&nbsp; I say all this to myself; but I know I
shall succumb!&nbsp; I have a distinct recollection that in the
old days, when you were about fifteen, you always could make me
do whatever you liked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He succumbed.&nbsp; He begins his story for her with the
minute narration of this adventure which took about twelve months
to develop.&nbsp; In the form in which it is presented here it
has been pruned of all allusions to their common past, of all
asides, disquisitions, and explanations addressed directly to the
friend of his childhood.&nbsp; And even as it is the whole thing
is of considerable length.&nbsp; It seems that he had not only a
memory but that he also knew how to remember.&nbsp; But as to
that opinions may differ.</p>
<p>This, his first great adventure, as he calls it, begins in
Marseilles.&nbsp; It ends there, too.&nbsp; Yet it might have
happened anywhere.&nbsp; This does not mean that the people
concerned could have come together in pure space.&nbsp; The
locality had a definite importance.&nbsp; As to the time, it is
easily fixed by the events at about the middle years of the
seventies, when Don Carlos de Bourbon, encouraged by the general
reaction of all Europe against the excesses of communistic
Republicanism, made his attempt for the throne of Spain, arms in
hand, amongst the hills and gorges of Guipuzcoa.&nbsp; It is
perhaps the last instance of a Pretender&rsquo;s adventure for a
Crown that History will have to record with the usual grave moral
disapproval tinged by a shamefaced regret for the departing
romance.&nbsp; Historians are very much like other people.</p>
<p>However, History has nothing to do with this tale.&nbsp;
Neither is the moral justification or condemnation of conduct
aimed at here.&nbsp; If anything it is perhaps a little sympathy
that the writer expects for his buried youth, as he lives it over
again at the end of his insignificant course on this earth.&nbsp;
Strange person&mdash;yet perhaps not so very different from
ourselves.</p>
<p>A few words as to certain facts may be added.</p>
<p>It may seem that he was plunged very abruptly into this long
adventure.&nbsp; But from certain passages (suppressed here
because mixed up with irrelevant matter) it appears clearly that
at the time of the meeting in the caf&eacute;, Mills had already
gathered, in various quarters, a definite view of the eager youth
who had been introduced to him in that ultra-legitimist
salon.&nbsp; What Mills had learned represented him as a young
gentleman who had arrived furnished with proper credentials and
who apparently was doing his best to waste his life in an
eccentric fashion, with a bohemian set (one poet, at least,
emerged out of it later) on one side, and on the other making
friends with the people of the Old Town, pilots, coasters,
sailors, workers of all sorts.&nbsp; He pretended rather absurdly
to be a seaman himself and was already credited with an
ill-defined and vaguely illegal enterprise in the Gulf of
Mexico.&nbsp; At once it occurred to Mills that this eccentric
youngster was the very person for what the legitimist
sympathizers had very much at heart just then: to organize a
supply by sea of arms and ammunition to the Carlist detachments
in the South.&nbsp; It was precisely to confer on that matter
with Do&ntilde;a Rita that Captain Blunt had been despatched from
Headquarters.</p>
<p>Mills got in touch with Blunt at once and put the suggestion
before him.&nbsp; The Captain thought this the very thing.&nbsp;
As a matter of fact, on that evening of Carnival, those two,
Mills and Blunt, had been actually looking everywhere for our
man.&nbsp; They had decided that he should be drawn into the
affair if it could be done.&nbsp; Blunt naturally wanted to see
him first.&nbsp; He must have estimated him a promising person,
but, from another point of view, not dangerous.&nbsp; Thus
lightly was the notorious (and at the same time mysterious)
Monsieur George brought into the world; out of the contact of two
minds which did not give a single thought to his flesh and
blood.</p>
<p>Their purpose explains the intimate tone given to their first
conversation and the sudden introduction of Do&ntilde;a
Rita&rsquo;s history.&nbsp; Mills, of course, wanted to hear all
about it.&nbsp; As to Captain Blunt&mdash;I suspect that, at the
time, he was thinking of nothing else.&nbsp; In addition it was
Do&ntilde;a Rita who would have to do the persuading; for, after
all, such an enterprise with its ugly and desperate risks was not
a trifle to put before a man&mdash;however young.</p>
<p>It cannot be denied that Mills seems to have acted somewhat
unscrupulously.&nbsp; He himself appears to have had some doubt
about it, at a given moment, as they were driving to the
Prado.&nbsp; But perhaps Mills, with his penetration, understood
very well the nature he was dealing with.&nbsp; He might even
have envied it.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s not my business to excuse
Mills.&nbsp; As to him whom we may regard as Mills&rsquo; victim
it is obvious that he has never harboured a single reproachful
thought.&nbsp; For him Mills is not to be criticized.&nbsp; A
remarkable instance of the great power of mere individuality over
the young.</p>
<h2>PART ONE</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
<p>Certain streets have an atmosphere of their own, a sort of
universal fame and the particular affection of their
citizens.&nbsp; One of such streets is the Cannebi&egrave;re, and
the jest: &ldquo;If Paris had a Cannebi&egrave;re it would be a
little Marseilles&rdquo; is the jocular expression of municipal
pride.&nbsp; I, too, I have been under the spell.&nbsp; For me it
has been a street leading into the unknown.</p>
<p>There was a part of it where one could see as many as five big
caf&eacute;s in a resplendent row.&nbsp; That evening I strolled
into one of them.&nbsp; It was by no means full.&nbsp; It looked
deserted, in fact, festal and overlighted, but cheerful.&nbsp;
The wonderful street was distinctly cold (it was an evening of
carnival), I was very idle, and I was feeling a little
lonely.&nbsp; So I went in and sat down.</p>
<p>The carnival time was drawing to an end.&nbsp; Everybody, high
and low, was anxious to have the last fling.&nbsp; Companies of
masks with linked arms and whooping like red Indians swept the
streets in crazy rushes while gusts of cold mistral swayed the
gas lights as far as the eye could reach.&nbsp; There was a touch
of bedlam in all this.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was that which made me feel lonely, since I was
neither masked, nor disguised, nor yelling, nor in any other way
in harmony with the bedlam element of life.&nbsp; But I was not
sad.&nbsp; I was merely in a state of sobriety.&nbsp; I had just
returned from my second West Indies voyage.&nbsp; My eyes were
still full of tropical splendour, my memory of my experiences,
lawful and lawless, which had their charm and their thrill; for
they had startled me a little and had amused me
considerably.&nbsp; But they had left me untouched.&nbsp; Indeed
they were other men&rsquo;s adventures, not mine.&nbsp; Except
for a little habit of responsibility which I had acquired they
had not matured me.&nbsp; I was as young as before.&nbsp;
Inconceivably young&mdash;still beautifully
unthinking&mdash;infinitely receptive.</p>
<p>You may believe that I was not thinking of Don Carlos and his
fight for a kingdom.&nbsp; Why should I?&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t
want to think of things which you meet every day in the
newspapers and in conversation.&nbsp; I had paid some calls since
my return and most of my acquaintance were legitimists and
intensely interested in the events of the frontier of Spain, for
political, religious, or romantic reasons.&nbsp; But I was not
interested.&nbsp; Apparently I was not romantic enough.&nbsp; Or
was it that I was even more romantic than all those good
people?&nbsp; The affair seemed to me commonplace.&nbsp; That man
was attending to his business of a Pretender.</p>
<p>On the front page of the illustrated paper I saw lying on a
table near me, he looked picturesque enough, seated on a boulder,
a big strong man with a square-cut beard, his hands resting on
the hilt of a cavalry sabre&mdash;and all around him a landscape
of savage mountains.&nbsp; He caught my eye on that spiritedly
composed woodcut.&nbsp; (There were no inane
snapshot-reproductions in those days.)&nbsp; It was the obvious
romance for the use of royalists but it arrested my
attention.</p>
<p>Just then some masks from outside invaded the caf&eacute;,
dancing hand in hand in a single file led by a burly man with a
cardboard nose.&nbsp; He gambolled in wildly and behind him
twenty others perhaps, mostly Pierrots and Pierrettes holding
each other by the hand and winding in and out between the chairs
and tables: eyes shining in the holes of cardboard faces, breasts
panting; but all preserving a mysterious silence.</p>
<p>They were people of the poorer sort (white calico with red
spots, costumes), but amongst them there was a girl in a black
dress sewn over with gold half moons, very high in the neck and
very short in the skirt.&nbsp; Most of the ordinary clients of
the caf&eacute; didn&rsquo;t even look up from their games or
papers.&nbsp; I, being alone and idle, stared abstractedly.&nbsp;
The girl costumed as Night wore a small black velvet mask, what
is called in French a &ldquo;<i>loup</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; What made
her daintiness join that obviously rough lot I can&rsquo;t
imagine.&nbsp; Her uncovered mouth and chin suggested refined
prettiness.</p>
<p>They filed past my table; the Night noticed perhaps my fixed
gaze and throwing her body forward out of the wriggling chain
shot out at me a slender tongue like a pink dart.&nbsp; I was not
prepared for this, not even to the extent of an appreciative
&ldquo;<i>Tr&egrave;s foli</i>,&rdquo; before she wriggled and
hopped away.&nbsp; But having been thus distinguished I could do
no less than follow her with my eyes to the door where the chain
of hands being broken all the masks were trying to get out at
once.&nbsp; Two gentlemen coming in out of the street stood
arrested in the crush.&nbsp; The Night (it must have been her
idiosyncrasy) put her tongue out at them, too.&nbsp; The taller
of the two (he was in evening clothes under a light wide-open
overcoat) with great presence of mind chucked her under the chin,
giving me the view at the same time of a flash of white teeth in
his dark, lean face.&nbsp; The other man was very different;
fair, with smooth, ruddy cheeks and burly shoulders.&nbsp; He was
wearing a grey suit, obviously bought ready-made, for it seemed
too tight for his powerful frame.</p>
<p>That man was not altogether a stranger to me.&nbsp; For the
last week or so I had been rather on the look-out for him in all
the public places where in a provincial town men may expect to
meet each other.&nbsp; I saw him for the first time (wearing that
same grey ready-made suit) in a legitimist drawing-room where,
clearly, he was an object of interest, especially to the
women.&nbsp; I had caught his name as Monsieur Mills.&nbsp; The
lady who had introduced me took the earliest opportunity to
murmur into my ear: &ldquo;A relation of Lord X.&rdquo;&nbsp;
(<i>Un proche parent de Lord X</i>.)&nbsp; And then she added,
casting up her eyes: &ldquo;A good friend of the
King.&rdquo;&nbsp; Meaning Don Carlos of course.</p>
<p>I looked at the <i>proche parent</i>; not on account of the
parentage but marvelling at his air of ease in that cumbrous body
and in such tight clothes, too.&nbsp; But presently the same lady
informed me further: &ldquo;He has come here amongst us <i>un
naufrag&eacute;</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I became then really interested.&nbsp; I had never seen a
shipwrecked person before.&nbsp; All the boyishness in me was
aroused.&nbsp; I considered a shipwreck as an unavoidable event
sooner or later in my future.</p>
<p>Meantime the man thus distinguished in my eyes glanced quietly
about and never spoke unless addressed directly by one of the
ladies present.&nbsp; There were more than a dozen people in that
drawing-room, mostly women eating fine pastry and talking
passionately.&nbsp; It might have been a Carlist committee
meeting of a particularly fatuous character.&nbsp; Even my youth
and inexperience were aware of that.&nbsp; And I was by a long
way the youngest person in the room.&nbsp; That quiet Monsieur
Mills intimidated me a little by his age (I suppose he was
thirty-five), his massive tranquillity, his clear, watchful
eyes.&nbsp; But the temptation was too great&mdash;and I
addressed him impulsively on the subject of that shipwreck.</p>
<p>He turned his big fair face towards me with surprise in his
keen glance, which (as though he had seen through me in an
instant and found nothing objectionable) changed subtly into
friendliness.&nbsp; On the matter of the shipwreck he did not say
much.&nbsp; He only told me that it had not occurred in the
Mediterranean, but on the other side of Southern France&mdash;in
the Bay of Biscay.&nbsp; &ldquo;But this is hardly the place to
enter on a story of that kind,&rdquo; he observed, looking round
at the room with a faint smile as attractive as the rest of his
rustic but well-bred personality.</p>
<p>I expressed my regret.&nbsp; I should have liked to hear all
about it.&nbsp; To this he said that it was not a secret and that
perhaps next time we met. . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where can we meet?&rdquo; I cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t come often to this house, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&nbsp; Why on the Cannebi&egrave;re to be
sure.&nbsp; Everybody meets everybody else at least once a day on
the pavement opposite the <i>Bourse</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was absolutely true.&nbsp; But though I looked for him on
each succeeding day he was nowhere to be seen at the usual
times.&nbsp; The companions of my idle hours (and all my hours
were idle just then) noticed my preoccupation and chaffed me
about it in a rather obvious way.&nbsp; They wanted to know
whether she, whom I expected to see, was dark or fair; whether
that fascination which kept me on tenterhooks of expectation was
one of my aristocrats or one of my marine beauties: for they knew
I had a footing in both these&mdash;shall we say circles?&nbsp;
As to themselves they were the bohemian circle, not very
wide&mdash;half a dozen of us led by a sculptor whom we called
Prax for short.&nbsp; My own nick-name was &ldquo;Young
Ulysses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I liked it.</p>
<p>But chaff or no chaff they would have been surprised to see me
leave them for the burly and sympathetic Mills.&nbsp; I was ready
to drop any easy company of equals to approach that interesting
man with every mental deference.&nbsp; It was not precisely
because of that shipwreck.&nbsp; He attracted and interested me
the more because he was not to be seen.&nbsp; The fear that he
might have departed suddenly for England&mdash;(or for
Spain)&mdash;caused me a sort of ridiculous depression as though
I had missed a unique opportunity.&nbsp; And it was a joyful
reaction which emboldened me to signal to him with a raised arm
across that caf&eacute;.</p>
<p>I was abashed immediately afterwards, when I saw him advance
towards my table with his friend.&nbsp; The latter was eminently
elegant.&nbsp; He was exactly like one of those figures one can
see of a fine May evening in the neighbourhood of the Opera-house
in Paris.&nbsp; Very Parisian indeed.&nbsp; And yet he struck me
as not so perfectly French as he ought to have been, as if
one&rsquo;s nationality were an accomplishment with varying
degrees of excellence.&nbsp; As to Mills, he was perfectly
insular.&nbsp; There could be no doubt about him.&nbsp; They were
both smiling faintly at me.&nbsp; The burly Mills attended to the
introduction: &ldquo;Captain Blunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We shook hands.&nbsp; The name didn&rsquo;t tell me
much.&nbsp; What surprised me was that Mills should have
remembered mine so well.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want to boast of my
modesty but it seemed to me that two or three days was more than
enough for a man like Mills to forget my very existence.&nbsp; As
to the Captain, I was struck on closer view by the perfect
correctness of his personality.&nbsp; Clothes, slight figure,
clear-cut, thin, sun-tanned face, pose, all this was so good that
it was saved from the danger of banality only by the mobile black
eyes of a keenness that one doesn&rsquo;t meet every day in the
south of France and still less in Italy.&nbsp; Another thing was
that, viewed as an officer in mufti, he did not look sufficiently
professional.&nbsp; That imperfection was interesting, too.</p>
<p>You may think that I am subtilizing my impressions on purpose,
but you may take it from a man who has lived a rough, a very
rough life, that it is the subtleties of personalities, and
contacts, and events, that count for interest and
memory&mdash;and pretty well nothing else.&nbsp; This&mdash;you
see&mdash;is the last evening of that part of my life in which I
did not know that woman.&nbsp; These are like the last hours of a
previous existence.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t my fault that they are
associated with nothing better at the decisive moment than the
banal splendours of a gilded caf&eacute; and the bedlamite yells
of carnival in the street.</p>
<p>We three, however (almost complete strangers to each other),
had assumed attitudes of serious amiability round our
table.&nbsp; A waiter approached for orders and it was then, in
relation to my order for coffee, that the absolutely first thing
I learned of Captain Blunt was the fact that he was a sufferer
from insomnia.&nbsp; In his immovable way Mills began charging
his pipe.&nbsp; I felt extremely embarrassed all at once, but
became positively annoyed when I saw our Prax enter the
caf&eacute; in a sort of mediaeval costume very much like what
Faust wears in the third act.&nbsp; I have no doubt it was meant
for a purely operatic Faust.&nbsp; A light mantle floated from
his shoulders.&nbsp; He strode theatrically up to our table and
addressing me as &ldquo;Young Ulysses&rdquo; proposed I should go
outside on the fields of asphalt and help him gather a few
marguerites to decorate a truly infernal supper which was being
organized across the road at the Maison
Dor&eacute;e&mdash;upstairs.&nbsp; With expostulatory shakes of
the head and indignant glances I called his attention to the fact
that I was not alone.&nbsp; He stepped back a pace as if
astonished by the discovery, took off his plumed velvet toque
with a low obeisance so that the feathers swept the floor, and
swaggered off the stage with his left hand resting on the hilt of
the property dagger at his belt.</p>
<p>Meantime the well-connected but rustic Mills had been busy
lighting his briar and the distinguished Captain sat smiling to
himself.&nbsp; I was horribly vexed and apologized for that
intrusion, saying that the fellow was a future great sculptor and
perfectly harmless; but he had been swallowing lots of night air
which had got into his head apparently.</p>
<p>Mills peered at me with his friendly but awfully searching
blue eyes through the cloud of smoke he had wreathed about his
big head.&nbsp; The slim, dark Captain&rsquo;s smile took on an
amiable expression.&nbsp; Might he know why I was addressed as
&ldquo;Young Ulysses&rdquo; by my friend? and immediately he
added the remark with urbane playfulness that Ulysses was an
astute person.&nbsp; Mills did not give me time for a
reply.&nbsp; He struck in: &ldquo;That old Greek was famed as a
wanderer&mdash;the first historical seaman.&rdquo;&nbsp; He waved
his pipe vaguely at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; <i>Vraiment</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; The polite
Captain seemed incredulous and as if weary.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you
a seaman?&nbsp; In what sense, pray?&rdquo;&nbsp; We were talking
French and he used the term <i>homme de mer</i>.</p>
<p>Again Mills interfered quietly.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the same sense
in which you are a military man.&rdquo;&nbsp; (<i>Homme de
guerre</i>.)</p>
<p>It was then that I heard Captain Blunt produce one of his
striking declarations.&nbsp; He had two of them, and this was the
first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I live by my sword.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was said in an extraordinary dandified manner which in
conjunction with the matter made me forget my tongue in my
head.&nbsp; I could only stare at him.&nbsp; He added more
naturally: &ldquo;2nd Reg.&nbsp; Castille, Cavalry.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then with marked stress in Spanish, &ldquo;<i>En las filas
legitimas</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mills was heard, unmoved, like Jove in his cloud:
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s on leave here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t shout that fact on the
housetops,&rdquo; the Captain addressed me pointedly, &ldquo;any
more than our friend his shipwreck adventure.&nbsp; We must not
strain the toleration of the French authorities too much!&nbsp;
It wouldn&rsquo;t be correct&mdash;and not very safe
either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I became suddenly extremely delighted with my company.&nbsp; A
man who &ldquo;lived by his sword,&rdquo; before my eyes, close
at my elbow!&nbsp; So such people did exist in the world
yet!&nbsp; I had not been born too late!&nbsp; And across the
table with his air of watchful, unmoved benevolence, enough in
itself to arouse one&rsquo;s interest, there was the man with the
story of a shipwreck that mustn&rsquo;t be shouted on
housetops.&nbsp; Why?</p>
<p>I understood very well why, when he told me that he had joined
in the Clyde a small steamer chartered by a relative of his,
&ldquo;a very wealthy man,&rdquo; he observed (probably Lord X, I
thought), to carry arms and other supplies to the Carlist
army.&nbsp; And it was not a shipwreck in the ordinary
sense.&nbsp; Everything went perfectly well to the last moment
when suddenly the <i>Numancia</i> (a Republican ironclad) had
appeared and chased them ashore on the French coast below
Bayonne.&nbsp; In a few words, but with evident appreciation of
the adventure, Mills described to us how he swam to the beach
clad simply in a money belt and a pair of trousers.&nbsp; Shells
were falling all round till a tiny French gunboat came out of
Bayonne and shooed the <i>Numancia</i> away out of territorial
waters.</p>
<p>He was very amusing and I was fascinated by the mental picture
of that tranquil man rolling in the surf and emerging breathless,
in the costume you know, on the fair land of France, in the
character of a smuggler of war material.&nbsp; However, they had
never arrested or expelled him, since he was there before my
eyes.&nbsp; But how and why did he get so far from the scene of
his sea adventure was an interesting question.&nbsp; And I put it
to him with most na&iuml;ve indiscretion which did not shock him
visibly.&nbsp; He told me that the ship being only stranded, not
sunk, the contraband cargo aboard was doubtless in good
condition.&nbsp; The French custom-house men were guarding the
wreck.&nbsp; If their vigilance could
be&mdash;h&rsquo;m&mdash;removed by some means, or even merely
reduced, a lot of these rifles and cartridges could be taken off
quietly at night by certain Spanish fishing boats.&nbsp; In fact,
salved for the Carlists, after all.&nbsp; He thought it could be
done. . . .</p>
<p>I said with professional gravity that given a few perfectly
quiet nights (rare on that coast) it could certainly be done.</p>
<p>Mr. Mills was not afraid of the elements.&nbsp; It was the
highly inconvenient zeal of the French custom-house people that
had to be dealt with in some way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; I cried, astonished.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
can&rsquo;t bribe the French Customs.&nbsp; This isn&rsquo;t a
South-American republic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it a republic?&rdquo; he murmured, very absorbed in
smoking his wooden pipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He murmured again, &ldquo;Oh, so little.&rdquo;&nbsp; At this
I laughed, and a faintly humorous expression passed over
Mills&rsquo; face.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Bribes were out of the
question, he admitted.&nbsp; But there were many legitimist
sympathies in Paris.&nbsp; A proper person could set them in
motion and a mere hint from high quarters to the officials on the
spot not to worry over-much about that wreck. . . .</p>
<p>What was most amusing was the cool, reasonable tone of this
amazing project.&nbsp; Mr. Blunt sat by very detached, his eyes
roamed here and there all over the caf&eacute;; and it was while
looking upward at the pink foot of a fleshy and very much
foreshortened goddess of some sort depicted on the ceiling in an
enormous composition in the Italian style that he let fall
casually the words, &ldquo;She will manage it for you quite
easily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every Carlist agent in Bayonne assured me of
that,&rdquo; said Mr. Mills.&nbsp; &ldquo;I would have gone
straight to Paris only I was told she had fled here for a rest;
tired, discontented.&nbsp; Not a very encouraging
report.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These flights are well known,&rdquo; muttered Mr.
Blunt.&nbsp; &ldquo;You shall see her all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; They told me that you . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>I broke in: &ldquo;You mean to say that you expect a woman to
arrange that sort of thing for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A trifle, for her,&rdquo; Mr. Blunt remarked
indifferently.&nbsp; &ldquo;At that sort of thing women are
best.&nbsp; They have less scruples.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More audacity,&rdquo; interjected Mr. Mills almost in a
whisper.</p>
<p>Mr. Blunt kept quiet for a moment, then: &ldquo;You
see,&rdquo; he addressed me in a most refined tone, &ldquo;a mere
man may suddenly find himself being kicked down the
stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why I should have felt shocked by that
statement.&nbsp; It could not be because it was untrue.&nbsp; The
other did not give me time to offer any remark.&nbsp; He inquired
with extreme politeness what did I know of South American
republics?&nbsp; I confessed that I knew very little of
them.&nbsp; Wandering about the Gulf of Mexico I had a look-in
here and there; and amongst others I had a few days in Haiti
which was of course unique, being a negro republic.&nbsp; On this
Captain Blunt began to talk of negroes at large.&nbsp; He talked
of them with knowledge, intelligence, and a sort of contemptuous
affection.&nbsp; He generalized, he particularized about the
blacks; he told anecdotes.&nbsp; I was interested, a little
incredulous, and considerably surprised.&nbsp; What could this
man with such a boulevardier exterior that he looked positively
like, an exile in a provincial town, and with his drawing-room
manner&mdash;what could he know of negroes?</p>
<p>Mills, sitting silent with his air of watchful intelligence,
seemed to read my thoughts, waved his pipe slightly and
explained: &ldquo;The Captain is from South Carolina.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I murmured, and then after the slightest of
pauses I heard the second of Mr. J. K. Blunt&rsquo;s
declarations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Je suis
Am&eacute;ricain</i>, <i>catholique et gentil-homme</i>,&rdquo;
in a tone contrasting so strongly with the smile, which, as it
were, underlined the uttered words, that I was at a loss whether
to return the smile in kind or acknowledge the words with a grave
little bow.&nbsp; Of course I did neither and there fell on us an
odd, equivocal silence.&nbsp; It marked our final abandonment of
the French language.&nbsp; I was the one to speak first,
proposing that my companions should sup with me, not across the
way, which would be riotous with more than one
&ldquo;infernal&rdquo; supper, but in another much more select
establishment in a side street away from the
Cannebi&egrave;re.&nbsp; It flattered my vanity a little to be
able to say that I had a corner table always reserved in the
Salon des Palmiers, otherwise Salon Blanc, where the atmosphere
was legitimist and extremely decorous besides&mdash;even in
Carnival time.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nine tenths of the people
there,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;would be of your political opinions,
if that&rsquo;s an inducement.&nbsp; Come along.&nbsp;
Let&rsquo;s be festive,&rdquo; I encouraged them.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t feel particularly festive.&nbsp; What I wanted
was to remain in my company and break an inexplicable feeling of
constraint of which I was aware.&nbsp; Mills looked at me
steadily with a faint, kind smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Blunt.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why should we go
there?&nbsp; They will be only turning us out in the small hours,
to go home and face insomnia.&nbsp; Can you imagine anything more
disgusting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was smiling all the time, but his deep-set eyes did not
lend themselves to the expression of whimsical politeness which
he tried to achieve.&nbsp; He had another suggestion to
offer.&nbsp; Why shouldn&rsquo;t we adjourn to his rooms?&nbsp;
He had there materials for a dish of his own invention for which
he was famous all along the line of the Royal Cavalry outposts,
and he would cook it for us.&nbsp; There were also a few bottles
of some white wine, quite possible, which we could drink out of
Venetian cut-glass goblets.&nbsp; A <i>bivouac</i> feast, in
fact.&nbsp; And he wouldn&rsquo;t turn us out in the small
hours.&nbsp; Not he.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t sleep.</p>
<p>Need I say I was fascinated by the idea?&nbsp; Well,
yes.&nbsp; But somehow I hesitated and looked towards Mills, so
much my senior.&nbsp; He got up without a word.&nbsp; This was
decisive; for no obscure premonition, and of something indefinite
at that, could stand against the example of his tranquil
personality.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>
<p>The street in which Mr. Blunt lived presented itself to our
eyes, narrow, silent, empty, and dark, but with enough gas-lamps
in it to disclose its most striking feature: a quantity of
flag-poles sticking out above many of its closed portals.&nbsp;
It was the street of Consuls and I remarked to Mr. Blunt that
coming out in the morning he could survey the flags of all
nations almost&mdash;except his own.&nbsp; (The U. S. consulate
was on the other side of the town.)&nbsp; He mumbled through his
teeth that he took good care to keep clear of his own
consulate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you afraid of the consul&rsquo;s dog?&rdquo; I
asked jocularly.&nbsp; The consul&rsquo;s dog weighed about a
pound and a half and was known to the whole town as exhibited on
the consular fore-arm in all places, at all hours, but mainly at
the hour of the fashionable promenade on the Prado.</p>
<p>But I felt my jest misplaced when Mills growled low in my ear:
&ldquo;They are all Yankees there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I murmured a confused &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Books are nothing.&nbsp; I discovered that I had never been
aware before that the Civil War in America was not printed matter
but a fact only about ten years old.&nbsp; Of course.&nbsp; He
was a South Carolinian gentleman.&nbsp; I was a little ashamed of
my want of tact.&nbsp; Meantime, looking like the conventional
conception of a fashionable reveller, with his opera-hat pushed
off his forehead, Captain Blunt was having some slight difficulty
with his latch-key; for the house before which we had stopped was
not one of those many-storied houses that made up the greater
part of the street.&nbsp; It had only one row of windows above
the ground floor.&nbsp; Dead walls abutting on to it indicated
that it had a garden.&nbsp; Its dark front presented no marked
architectural character, and in the flickering light of a street
lamp it looked a little as though it had gone down in the
world.&nbsp; The greater then was my surprise to enter a hall
paved in black and white marble and in its dimness appearing of
palatial proportions.&nbsp; Mr. Blunt did not turn up the small
solitary gas-jet, but led the way across the black and white
pavement past the end of the staircase, past a door of gleaming
dark wood with a heavy bronze handle.&nbsp; It gave access to his
rooms he said; but he took us straight on to the studio at the
end of the passage.</p>
<p>It was rather a small place tacked on in the manner of a
lean-to to the garden side of the house.&nbsp; A large lamp was
burning brightly there.&nbsp; The floor was of mere flag-stones
but the few rugs scattered about though extremely worn were very
costly.&nbsp; There was also there a beautiful sofa upholstered
in pink figured silk, an enormous divan with many cushions, some
splendid arm-chairs of various shapes (but all very shabby), a
round table, and in the midst of these fine things a small common
iron stove.&nbsp; Somebody must have been attending it lately,
for the fire roared and the warmth of the place was very grateful
after the bone-searching cold blasts of mistral outside.</p>
<p>Mills without a word flung himself on the divan and, propped
on his arm, gazed thoughtfully at a distant corner where in the
shadow of a monumental carved wardrobe an articulated dummy
without head or hands but with beautifully shaped limbs composed
in a shrinking attitude, seemed to be embarrassed by his
stare.</p>
<p>As we sat enjoying the <i>bivouac</i> hospitality (the dish
was really excellent and our host in a shabby grey jacket still
looked the accomplished man-about-town) my eyes kept on straying
towards that corner.&nbsp; Blunt noticed this and remarked that I
seemed to be attracted by the Empress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s disagreeable,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
seems to lurk there like a shy skeleton at the feast.&nbsp; But
why do you give the name of Empress to that dummy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it sat for days and days in the robes of a
Byzantine Empress to a painter. . . I wonder where he discovered
these priceless stuffs. . . You knew him, I believe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mills lowered his head slowly, then tossed down his throat
some wine out of a Venetian goblet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This house is full of costly objects.&nbsp; So are all
his other houses, so is his place in Paris&mdash;that mysterious
Pavilion hidden away in Passy somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mills knew the Pavilion.&nbsp; The wine had, I suppose,
loosened his tongue.&nbsp; Blunt, too, lost something of his
reserve.&nbsp; From their talk I gathered the notion of an
eccentric personality, a man of great wealth, not so much
solitary as difficult of access, a collector of fine things, a
painter known only to very few people and not at all to the
public market.&nbsp; But as meantime I had been emptying my
Venetian goblet with a certain regularity (the amount of heat
given out by that iron stove was amazing; it parched one&rsquo;s
throat, and the straw-coloured wine didn&rsquo;t seem much
stronger than so much pleasantly flavoured water) the voices and
the impressions they conveyed acquired something fantastic to my
mind.&nbsp; Suddenly I perceived that Mills was sitting in his
shirt-sleeves.&nbsp; I had not noticed him taking off his
coat.&nbsp; Blunt had unbuttoned his shabby jacket, exposing a
lot of starched shirt-front with the white tie under his dark
shaved chin.&nbsp; He had a strange air of insolence&mdash;or so
it seemed to me.&nbsp; I addressed him much louder than I
intended really.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you know that extraordinary man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To know him personally one had to be either very
distinguished or very lucky.&nbsp; Mr. Mills here . .
.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have been lucky,&rdquo; Mills struck in.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It was my cousin who was distinguished.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
how I managed to enter his house in Paris&mdash;it was called the
Pavilion&mdash;twice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And saw Do&ntilde;a Rita twice, too?&rdquo; asked Blunt
with an indefinite smile and a marked emphasis.&nbsp; Mills was
also emphatic in his reply but with a serious face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not an easy enthusiast where women are concerned,
but she was without doubt the most admirable find of his amongst
all the priceless items he had accumulated in that
house&mdash;the most admirable. . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; But, you see, of all the objects there she
was the only one that was alive,&rdquo; pointed out Blunt with
the slightest possible flavour of sarcasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Immensely so,&rdquo; affirmed Mills.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not
because she was restless, indeed she hardly ever moved from that
couch between the windows&mdash;you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve never
been in there,&rdquo; announced Blunt with that flash of white
teeth so strangely without any character of its own that it was
merely disturbing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she radiated life,&rdquo; continued Mills.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She had plenty of it, and it had a quality.&nbsp; My
cousin and Henry All&egrave;gre had a lot to say to each other
and so I was free to talk to her.&nbsp; At the second visit we
were like old friends, which was absurd considering that all the
chances were that we would never meet again in this world or in
the next.&nbsp; I am not meddling with theology but it seems to
me that in the Elysian fields she&rsquo;ll have her place in a
very special company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this in a sympathetic voice and in his unmoved
manner.&nbsp; Blunt produced another disturbing white flash and
muttered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say mixed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then louder: &ldquo;As
for instance . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for instance Cleopatra,&rdquo; answered Mills
quietly.&nbsp; He added after a pause: &ldquo;Who was not exactly
pretty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have thought rather a La
Valli&egrave;re,&rdquo; Blunt dropped with an indifference of
which one did not know what to make.&nbsp; He may have begun to
be bored with the subject.&nbsp; But it may have been put on, for
the whole personality was not clearly definable.&nbsp; I,
however, was not indifferent.&nbsp; A woman is always an
interesting subject and I was thoroughly awake to that
interest.&nbsp; Mills pondered for a while with a sort of
dispassionate benevolence, at last:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Do&ntilde;a Rita as far as I know her is so varied
in her simplicity that even that is possible,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; A romantic resigned La
Valli&egrave;re . . . who had a big mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt moved to make myself heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you know La Valli&egrave;re, too?&rdquo; I asked
impertinently.</p>
<p>Mills only smiled at me.&nbsp; &ldquo;No.&nbsp; I am not quite
so old as that,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not
very difficult to know facts of that kind about a historical
personage.&nbsp; There were some ribald verses made at the time,
and Louis XIV was congratulated on the possession&mdash;I really
don&rsquo;t remember how it goes&mdash;on the possession of:</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;. . . de ce bec amoureux<br />
Qui d&rsquo;une oreille &agrave; l&rsquo;autre va,<br />
Tra l&agrave; l&agrave;.</p>
<p>or something of the sort.&nbsp; It needn&rsquo;t be from ear
to ear, but it&rsquo;s a fact that a big mouth is often a sign of
a certain generosity of mind and feeling.&nbsp; Young man, beware
of women with small mouths.&nbsp; Beware of the others, too, of
course; but a small mouth is a fatal sign.&nbsp; Well, the
royalist sympathizers can&rsquo;t charge Do&ntilde;a Rita with
any lack of generosity from what I hear.&nbsp; Why should I judge
her?&nbsp; I have known her for, say, six hours altogether.&nbsp;
It was enough to feel the seduction of her native intelligence
and of her splendid physique.&nbsp; And all that was brought home
to me so quickly,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;because she had
what some Frenchman has called the &lsquo;terrible gift of
familiarity&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blunt had been listening moodily.&nbsp; He nodded assent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;&nbsp; Mills&rsquo; thoughts were still
dwelling in the past.&nbsp; &ldquo;And when saying good-bye she
could put in an instant an immense distance between herself and
you.&nbsp; A slight stiffening of that perfect figure, a change
of the physiognomy: it was like being dismissed by a person born
in the purple.&nbsp; Even if she did offer you her hand&mdash;as
she did to me&mdash;it was as if across a broad river.&nbsp;
Trick of manner or a bit of truth peeping out?&nbsp; Perhaps
she&rsquo;s really one of those inaccessible beings.&nbsp; What
do you think, Blunt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a direct question which for some reason (as if my range
of sensitiveness had been increased already) displeased or rather
disturbed me strangely.&nbsp; Blunt seemed not to have heard
it.&nbsp; But after a while he turned to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That thick man,&rdquo; he said in a tone of perfect
urbanity, &ldquo;is as fine as a needle.&nbsp; All these
statements about the seduction and then this final doubt
expressed after only two visits which could not have included
more than six hours altogether and this some three years
ago!&nbsp; But it is Henry All&egrave;gre that you should ask
this question, Mr. Mills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the secret of raising the dead,&rdquo;
answered Mills good humouredly.&nbsp; &ldquo;And if I had I would
hesitate.&nbsp; It would seem such a liberty to take with a
person one had known so slightly in life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet Henry All&egrave;gre is the only person to ask
about her, after all this uninterrupted companionship of years,
ever since he discovered her; all the time, every breathing
moment of it, till, literally, his very last breath.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t mean to say she nursed him.&nbsp; He had his
confidential man for that.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t bear women
about his person.&nbsp; But then apparently he couldn&rsquo;t
bear this one out of his sight.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s the only woman
who ever sat to him, for he would never suffer a model inside his
house.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why the &lsquo;Girl in the Hat&rsquo;
and the &lsquo;Byzantine Empress&rsquo; have that family air,
though neither of them is really a likeness of Do&ntilde;a Rita.
. . You know my mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mills inclined his body slightly and a fugitive smile vanished
from his lips.&nbsp; Blunt&rsquo;s eyes were fastened on the very
centre of his empty plate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then perhaps you know my mother&rsquo;s artistic and
literary associations,&rdquo; Blunt went on in a subtly changed
tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;My mother has been writing verse since she was
a girl of fifteen.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s still writing verse.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s still fifteen&mdash;a spoiled girl of genius.&nbsp;
So she requested one of her poet friends&mdash;no less than
Versoy himself&mdash;to arrange for a visit to Henry
All&egrave;gre&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; At first he thought he
hadn&rsquo;t heard aright.&nbsp; You must know that for my mother
a man that doesn&rsquo;t jump out of his skin for any
woman&rsquo;s caprice is not chivalrous.&nbsp; But perhaps you do
know? . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mills shook his head with an amused air.&nbsp; Blunt, who had
raised his eyes from his plate to look at him, started afresh
with great deliberation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She gives no peace to herself or her friends.&nbsp; My
mother&rsquo;s exquisitely absurd.&nbsp; You understand that all
these painters, poets, art collectors (and dealers in
bric-&agrave;-brac, he interjected through his teeth) of my
mother are not in my way; but Versoy lives more like a man of the
world.&nbsp; One day I met him at the fencing school.&nbsp; He
was furious.&nbsp; He asked me to tell my mother that this was
the last effort of his chivalry.&nbsp; The jobs she gave him to
do were too difficult.&nbsp; But I daresay he had been pleased
enough to show the influence he had in that quarter.&nbsp; He
knew my mother would tell the world&rsquo;s wife all about
it.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a spiteful, gingery little wretch.&nbsp; The
top of his head shines like a billiard ball.&nbsp; I believe he
polishes it every morning with a cloth.&nbsp; Of course they
didn&rsquo;t get further than the big drawing-room on the first
floor, an enormous drawing-room with three pairs of columns in
the middle.&nbsp; The double doors on the top of the staircase
had been thrown wide open, as if for a visit from royalty.&nbsp;
You can picture to yourself my mother, with her white hair done
in some 18th century fashion and her sparkling black eyes,
penetrating into those splendours attended by a sort of
bald-headed, vexed squirrel&mdash;and Henry All&egrave;gre coming
forward to meet them like a severe prince with the face of a
tombstone Crusader, big white hands, muffled silken voice,
half-shut eyes, as if looking down at them from a balcony.&nbsp;
You remember that trick of his, Mills?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mills emitted an enormous cloud of smoke out of his distended
cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay he was furious, too,&rdquo;&nbsp; Blunt
continued dispassionately.&nbsp; &ldquo;But he was extremely
civil.&nbsp; He showed her all the &lsquo;treasures&rsquo; in the
room, ivories, enamels, miniatures, all sorts of monstrosities
from Japan, from India, from Timbuctoo . . . for all I know. . .
He pushed his condescension so far as to have the &lsquo;Girl in
the Hat&rsquo; brought down into the drawing-room&mdash;half
length, unframed.&nbsp; They put her on a chair for my mother to
look at.&nbsp; The &lsquo;Byzantine Empress&rsquo; was already
there, hung on the end wall&mdash;full length, gold frame
weighing half a ton.&nbsp; My mother first overwhelms the
&lsquo;Master&rsquo; with thanks, and then absorbs herself in the
adoration of the &lsquo;Girl in the Hat.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then she
sighs out: &lsquo;It should be called Diaphan&eacute;it&eacute;,
if there is such a word.&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; This is the last
expression of modernity!&rsquo;&nbsp; She puts up suddenly her
face-&agrave;-main and looks towards the end wall.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And that&mdash;Byzantium itself!&nbsp; Who was she, this
sullen and beautiful Empress?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The one I had in my mind was
Theodosia!&rsquo;&nbsp; All&egrave;gre consented to answer.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Originally a slave girl&mdash;from somewhere.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother can be marvellously indiscreet when the whim
takes her.&nbsp; She finds nothing better to do than to ask the
&lsquo;Master&rsquo; why he took his inspiration for those two
faces from the same model.&nbsp; No doubt she was proud of her
discerning eye.&nbsp; It was really clever of her.&nbsp;
All&egrave;gre, however, looked on it as a colossal impertinence;
but he answered in his silkiest tones:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Perhaps it is because I saw in that woman
something of the women of all time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother might have guessed that she was on thin ice
there.&nbsp; She is extremely intelligent.&nbsp; Moreover, she
ought to have known.&nbsp; But women can be miraculously dense
sometimes.&nbsp; So she exclaims, &lsquo;Then she is a
wonder!&rsquo;&nbsp; And with some notion of being complimentary
goes on to say that only the eyes of the discoverer of so many
wonders of art could have discovered something so marvellous in
life.&nbsp; I suppose All&egrave;gre lost his temper altogether
then; or perhaps he only wanted to pay my mother out, for all
these &lsquo;Masters&rsquo; she had been throwing at his head for
the last two hours.&nbsp; He insinuates with the utmost
politeness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;As you are honouring my poor collection with a
visit you may like to judge for yourself as to the inspiration of
these two pictures.&nbsp; She is upstairs changing her dress
after our morning ride.&nbsp; But she wouldn&rsquo;t be very
long.&nbsp; She might be a little surprised at first to be called
down like this, but with a few words of preparation and purely as
a matter of art . . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were never two people more taken aback.&nbsp;
Versoy himself confesses that he dropped his tall hat with a
crash.&nbsp; I am a dutiful son, I hope, but I must say I should
have liked to have seen the retreat down the great
staircase.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; Ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed most undutifully and then his face twitched
grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That implacable brute All&egrave;gre followed them down
ceremoniously and put my mother into the fiacre at the door with
the greatest deference.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t open his lips
though, and made a great bow as the fiacre drove away.&nbsp; My
mother didn&rsquo;t recover from her consternation for three
days.&nbsp; I lunch with her almost daily and I couldn&rsquo;t
imagine what was the matter.&nbsp; Then one day . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>He glanced round the table, jumped up and with a word of
excuse left the studio by a small door in a corner.&nbsp; This
startled me into the consciousness that I had been as if I had
not existed for these two men.&nbsp; With his elbows propped on
the table Mills had his hands in front of his face clasping the
pipe from which he extracted now and then a puff of smoke,
staring stolidly across the room.</p>
<p>I was moved to ask in a whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know him well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what he is driving at,&rdquo; he
answered drily.&nbsp; &ldquo;But as to his mother she is not as
volatile as all that.&nbsp; I suspect it was business.&nbsp; It
may have been a deep plot to get a picture out of All&egrave;gre
for somebody.&nbsp; My cousin as likely as not.&nbsp; Or simply
to discover what he had.&nbsp; The Blunts lost all their property
and in Paris there are various ways of making a little money,
without actually breaking anything.&nbsp; Not even the law.&nbsp;
And Mrs. Blunt really had a position once&mdash;in the days of
the Second Empire&mdash;and so. . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>I listened open-mouthed to these things into which my
West-Indian experiences could not have given me an insight.&nbsp;
But Mills checked himself and ended in a changed tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not easy to know what she would be at,
either, in any given instance.&nbsp; For the rest, spotlessly
honourable.&nbsp; A delightful, aristocratic old lady.&nbsp; Only
poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A bump at the door silenced him and immediately Mr. John
Blunt, Captain of Cavalry in the Army of Legitimity, first-rate
cook (as to one dish at least), and generous host, entered
clutching the necks of four more bottles between the fingers of
his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stumbled and nearly smashed the lot,&rdquo; he
remarked casually.&nbsp; But even I, with all my innocence, never
for a moment believed he had stumbled accidentally.&nbsp; During
the uncorking and the filling up of glasses a profound silence
reigned; but neither of us took it seriously&mdash;any more than
his stumble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day,&rdquo; he went on again in that curiously
flavoured voice of his, &ldquo;my mother took a heroic decision
and made up her mind to get up in the middle of the night.&nbsp;
You must understand my mother&rsquo;s phraseology.&nbsp; It meant
that she would be up and dressed by nine o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp;
This time it was not Versoy that was commanded for attendance,
but I.&nbsp; You may imagine how delighted I was. . .
.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was very plain to me that Blunt was addressing himself
exclusively to Mills: Mills the mind, even more than Mills the
man.&nbsp; It was as if Mills represented something initiated and
to be reckoned with.&nbsp; I, of course, could have no such
pretensions.&nbsp; If I represented anything it was a perfect
freshness of sensations and a refreshing ignorance, not so much
of what life may give one (as to that I had some ideas at least)
but of what it really contains.&nbsp; I knew very well that I was
utterly insignificant in these men&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; Yet my
attention was not checked by that knowledge.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
true they were talking of a woman, but I was yet at the age when
this subject by itself is not of overwhelming interest.&nbsp; My
imagination would have been more stimulated probably by the
adventures and fortunes of a man.&nbsp; What kept my interest
from flagging was Mr. Blunt himself.&nbsp; The play of the white
gleams of his smile round the suspicion of grimness of his tone
fascinated me like a moral incongruity.</p>
<p>So at the age when one sleeps well indeed but does feel
sometimes as if the need of sleep were a mere weakness of a
distant old age, I kept easily awake; and in my freshness I was
kept amused by the contrast of personalities, of the disclosed
facts and moral outlook with the rough initiations of my
West-Indian experience.&nbsp; And all these things were dominated
by a feminine figure which to my imagination had only a floating
outline, now invested with the grace of girlhood, now with the
prestige of a woman; and indistinct in both these
characters.&nbsp; For these two men had <i>seen</i> her, while to
me she was only being &ldquo;presented,&rdquo; elusively, in
vanishing words, in the shifting tones of an unfamiliar
voice.</p>
<p>She was being presented to me now in the Bois de Boulogne at
the early hour of the ultra-fashionable world (so I understood),
on a light bay &ldquo;bit of blood&rdquo; attended on the off
side by that Henry All&egrave;gre mounted on a dark brown
powerful weight carrier; and on the other by one of
All&egrave;gre&rsquo;s acquaintances (the man had no real
friends), distinguished frequenters of that mysterious
Pavilion.&nbsp; And so that side of the frame in which that woman
appeared to one down the perspective of the great All&eacute;e
was not permanent.&nbsp; That morning when Mr. Blunt had to
escort his mother there for the gratification of her irresistible
curiosity (of which he highly disapproved) there appeared in
succession, at that woman&rsquo;s or girl&rsquo;s bridle-hand, a
cavalry general in red breeches, on whom she was smiling; a
rising politician in a grey suit, who talked to her with great
animation but left her side abruptly to join a personage in a red
fez and mounted on a white horse; and then, some time afterwards,
the vexed Mr. Blunt and his indiscreet mother (though I really
couldn&rsquo;t see where the harm was) had one more chance of a
good stare.&nbsp; The third party that time was the Royal
Pretender (All&egrave;gre had been painting his portrait lately),
whose hearty, sonorous laugh was heard long before the mounted
trio came riding very slowly abreast of the Blunts.&nbsp; There
was colour in the girl&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; She was not
laughing.&nbsp; Her expression was serious and her eyes
thoughtfully downcast.&nbsp; Blunt admitted that on that occasion
the charm, brilliance, and force of her personality was
adequately framed between those magnificently mounted,
paladin-like attendants, one older than the other but the two
composing together admirably in the different stages of their
manhood.&nbsp; Mr. Blunt had never before seen Henry
All&egrave;gre so close.&nbsp; All&egrave;gre was riding nearest
to the path on which Blunt was dutifully giving his arm to his
mother (they had got out of their fiacre) and wondering if that
confounded fellow would have the impudence to take off his
hat.&nbsp; But he did not.&nbsp; Perhaps he didn&rsquo;t
notice.&nbsp; All&egrave;gre was not a man of wandering
glances.&nbsp; There were silver hairs in his beard but he looked
as solid as a statue.&nbsp; Less than three months afterwards he
was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; asked Mills, who had not changed
his pose for a very long time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, an accident.&nbsp; But he lingered.&nbsp; They were
on their way to Corsica.&nbsp; A yearly pilgrimage.&nbsp;
Sentimental perhaps.&nbsp; It was to Corsica that he carried her
off&mdash;I mean first of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was the slightest contraction of Mr. Blunt&rsquo;s
facial muscles.&nbsp; Very slight; but I, staring at the narrator
after the manner of all simple souls, noticed it; the twitch of a
pain which surely must have been mental.&nbsp; There was also a
suggestion of effort before he went on: &ldquo;I suppose you know
how he got hold of her?&rdquo; in a tone of ease which was
astonishingly ill-assumed for such a worldly, self-controlled,
drawing-room person.</p>
<p>Mills changed his attitude to look at him fixedly for a
moment.&nbsp; Then he leaned back in his chair and with
interest&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean curiosity, I mean interest:
&ldquo;Does anybody know besides the two parties
concerned?&rdquo; he asked, with something as it were renewed (or
was it refreshed?) in his unmoved quietness.&nbsp; &ldquo;I ask
because one has never heard any tales.&nbsp; I remember one
evening in a restaurant seeing a man come in with a lady&mdash;a
beautiful lady&mdash;very particularly beautiful, as though she
had been stolen out of Mahomet&rsquo;s paradise.&nbsp; With
Do&ntilde;a Rita it can&rsquo;t be anything as definite as
that.&nbsp; But speaking of her in the same strain, I&rsquo;ve
always felt that she looked as though All&egrave;gre had caught
her in the precincts of some temple . . . in the
mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was delighted.&nbsp; I had never heard before a woman spoken
about in that way, a real live woman that is, not a woman in a
book.&nbsp; For this was no poetry and yet it seemed to put her
in the category of visions.&nbsp; And I would have lost myself in
it if Mr. Blunt had not, most unexpectedly, addressed himself to
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you that man was as fine as a needle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then to Mills: &ldquo;Out of a temple?&nbsp; We know what
that means.&rdquo;&nbsp; His dark eyes flashed: &ldquo;And must
it be really in the mountains?&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or in a desert,&rdquo; conceded Mills, &ldquo;if you
prefer that.&nbsp; There have been temples in deserts, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blunt had calmed down suddenly and assumed a nonchalant
pose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a matter of fact, Henry All&egrave;gre caught her
very early one morning in his own old garden full of thrushes and
other small birds.&nbsp; She was sitting on a stone, a fragment
of some old balustrade, with her feet in the damp grass, and
reading a tattered book of some kind.&nbsp; She had on a short,
black, two-penny frock (<i>une petite robe de deux sous</i>) and
there was a hole in one of her stockings.&nbsp; She raised her
eyes and saw him looking down at her thoughtfully over that
ambrosian beard of his, like Jove at a mortal.&nbsp; They
exchanged a good long stare, for at first she was too startled to
move; and then he murmured, &ldquo;<i>Restez
donc</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; She lowered her eyes again on her book and
after a while heard him walk away on the path.&nbsp; Her heart
thumped while she listened to the little birds filling the air
with their noise.&nbsp; She was not frightened.&nbsp; I am
telling you this positively because she has told me the tale
herself.&nbsp; What better authority can you have . . .?&rdquo;
Blunt paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s not the sort of
person to lie about her own sensations,&rdquo; murmured Mills
above his clasped hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing can escape his penetration,&rdquo; Blunt
remarked to me with that equivocal urbanity which made me always
feel uncomfortable on Mills&rsquo; account.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Positively nothing.&rdquo;&nbsp; He turned to Mills
again.&nbsp; &ldquo;After some minutes of immobility&mdash;she
told me&mdash;she arose from her stone and walked slowly on the
track of that apparition.&nbsp; All&egrave;gre was nowhere to be
seen by that time.&nbsp; Under the gateway of the extremely ugly
tenement house, which hides the Pavilion and the garden from the
street, the wife of the porter was waiting with her arms
akimbo.&nbsp; At once she cried out to Rita: &lsquo;You were
caught by our gentleman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a matter of fact, that old woman, being a friend of
Rita&rsquo;s aunt, allowed the girl to come into the garden
whenever All&egrave;gre was away.&nbsp; But
All&egrave;gre&rsquo;s goings and comings were sudden and
unannounced; and that morning, Rita, crossing the narrow,
thronged street, had slipped in through the gateway in ignorance
of All&egrave;gre&rsquo;s return and unseen by the porter&rsquo;s
wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The child, she was but little more than that then,
expressed her regret of having perhaps got the kind
porter&rsquo;s wife into trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old woman said with a peculiar smile: &lsquo;Your
face is not of the sort that gets other people into
trouble.&nbsp; My gentleman wasn&rsquo;t angry.&nbsp; He says you
may come in any morning you like.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rita, without saying anything to this, crossed the
street back again to the warehouse full of oranges where she
spent most of her waking hours.&nbsp; Her dreaming, empty, idle,
thoughtless, unperturbed hours, she calls them.&nbsp; She crossed
the street with a hole in her stocking.&nbsp; She had a hole in
her stocking not because her uncle and aunt were poor (they had
around them never less than eight thousand oranges, mostly in
cases) but because she was then careless and untidy and totally
unconscious of her personal appearance.&nbsp; She told me herself
that she was not even conscious then of her personal
existence.&nbsp; She was a mere adjunct in the twilight life of
her aunt, a Frenchwoman, and her uncle, the orange merchant, a
Basque peasant, to whom her other uncle, the great man of the
family, the priest of some parish in the hills near Tolosa, had
sent her up at the age of thirteen or thereabouts for safe
keeping.&nbsp; She is of peasant stock, you know.&nbsp; This is
the true origin of the &lsquo;Girl in the Hat&rsquo; and of the
&lsquo;Byzantine Empress&rsquo; which excited my dear mother so
much; of the mysterious girl that the privileged personalities
great in art, in letters, in politics, or simply in the world,
could see on the big sofa during the gatherings in
All&egrave;gre&rsquo;s exclusive Pavilion: the Do&ntilde;a Rita
of their respectful addresses, manifest and mysterious, like an
object of art from some unknown period; the Do&ntilde;a Rita of
the initiated Paris.&nbsp; Do&ntilde;a Rita and nothing
more&mdash;unique and indefinable.&rdquo;&nbsp; He stopped with a
disagreeable smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And of peasant stock?&rdquo; I exclaimed in the
strangely conscious silence that fell between Mills and
Blunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; All these Basques have been ennobled by Don
Sanche II,&rdquo; said Captain Blunt moodily.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
see coats of arms carved over the doorways of the most miserable
<i>caserios</i>.&nbsp; As far as that goes she&rsquo;s
Do&ntilde;a Rita right enough whatever else she is or is not in
herself or in the eyes of others.&nbsp; In your eyes, for
instance, Mills.&nbsp; Eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time Mills preserved that conscious silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why think about it at all?&rdquo; he murmured coldly at
last.&nbsp; &ldquo;A strange bird is hatched sometimes in a nest
in an unaccountable way and then the fate of such a bird is bound
to be ill-defined, uncertain, questionable.&nbsp; And so that is
how Henry All&egrave;gre saw her first?&nbsp; And what happened
next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened next?&rdquo; repeated Mr. Blunt, with an
affected surprise in his tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it necessary to
ask that question?&nbsp; If you had asked <i>how</i> the next
happened. . .&nbsp; But as you may imagine she hasn&rsquo;t told
me anything about that.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he
continued with polite sarcasm, &ldquo;enlarge upon the
facts.&nbsp; That confounded All&egrave;gre, with his impudent
assumption of princely airs, must have (I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder)
made the fact of his notice appear as a sort of favour dropped
from Olympus.&nbsp; I really can&rsquo;t tell how the minds and
the imaginations of such aunts and uncles are affected by such
rare visitations.&nbsp; Mythology may give us a hint.&nbsp; There
is the story of Danae, for instance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is,&rdquo; remarked Mills calmly, &ldquo;but I
don&rsquo;t remember any aunt or uncle in that
connection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there are also certain stories of the discovery and
acquisition of some unique objects of art.&nbsp; The sly
approaches, the astute negotiations, the lying and the
circumventing . . . for the love of beauty, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With his dark face and with the perpetual smiles playing about
his grimness, Mr. Blunt appeared to me positively satanic.&nbsp;
Mills&rsquo; hand was toying absently with an empty glass.&nbsp;
Again they had forgotten my existence altogether.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how an object of art would
feel,&rdquo; went on Blunt, in an unexpectedly grating voice,
which, however, recovered its tone immediately.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; But I do know that Rita herself was not a
Danae, never, not at any time of her life.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t
mind the holes in her stockings.&nbsp; She wouldn&rsquo;t mind
holes in her stockings now. . . That is if she manages to keep
any stockings at all,&rdquo; he added, with a sort of suppressed
fury so funnily unexpected that I would have burst into a laugh
if I hadn&rsquo;t been lost in astonishment of the simplest
kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;really!&rdquo;&nbsp; There was a flash of
interest from the quiet Mills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, really,&rdquo;&nbsp; Blunt nodded and knitted his
brows very devilishly indeed.&nbsp; &ldquo;She may yet be left
without a single pair of stockings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world&rsquo;s a thief,&rdquo; declared Mills, with
the utmost composure.&nbsp; &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t mind robbing
a lonely traveller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is so subtle.&rdquo;&nbsp; Blunt remembered my
existence for the purpose of that remark and as usual it made me
very uncomfortable.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perfectly true.&nbsp; A lonely
traveller.&nbsp; They are all in the scramble from the lowest to
the highest.&nbsp; Heavens!&nbsp; What a gang!&nbsp; There was
even an Archbishop in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Vous plaisantez</i>,&rdquo; said Mills, but without
any marked show of incredulity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I joke very seldom,&rdquo; Blunt protested
earnestly.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I haven&rsquo;t
mentioned His Majesty&mdash;whom God preserve.&nbsp; That would
have been an exaggeration. . . However, the end is not yet.&nbsp;
We were talking about the beginning.&nbsp; I have heard that some
dealers in fine objects, quite mercenary people of course (my
mother has an experience in that world), show sometimes an
astonishing reluctance to part with some specimens, even at a
good price.&nbsp; It must be very funny.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s just
possible that the uncle and the aunt have been rolling in tears
on the floor, amongst their oranges, or beating their heads
against the walls from rage and despair.&nbsp; But I doubt
it.&nbsp; And in any case All&egrave;gre is not the sort of
person that gets into any vulgar trouble.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s
just possible that those people stood open-mouthed at all that
magnificence.&nbsp; They weren&rsquo;t poor, you know; therefore
it wasn&rsquo;t incumbent on them to be honest.&nbsp; They are
still there in the old respectable warehouse, I understand.&nbsp;
They have kept their position in their <i>quartier</i>, I
believe.&nbsp; But they didn&rsquo;t keep their niece.&nbsp; It
might have been an act of sacrifice!&nbsp; For I seem to remember
hearing that after attending for a while some school round the
corner the child had been set to keep the books of that orange
business.&nbsp; However it might have been, the first fact in
Rita&rsquo;s and All&egrave;gre&rsquo;s common history is a
journey to Italy, and then to Corsica.&nbsp; You know
All&egrave;gre had a house in Corsica somewhere.&nbsp; She has it
now as she has everything he ever had; and that Corsican palace
is the portion that will stick the longest to Do&ntilde;a Rita, I
imagine.&nbsp; Who would want to buy a place like that?&nbsp; I
suppose nobody would take it for a gift.&nbsp; The fellow was
having houses built all over the place.&nbsp; This very house
where we are sitting belonged to him.&nbsp; Do&ntilde;a Rita has
given it to her sister, I understand.&nbsp; Or at any rate the
sister runs it.&nbsp; She is my landlady . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her sister here!&rdquo; I exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Her
sister!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blunt turned to me politely, but only for a long mute
gaze.&nbsp; His eyes were in deep shadow and it struck me for the
first time then that there was something fatal in that
man&rsquo;s aspect as soon as he fell silent.&nbsp; I think the
effect was purely physical, but in consequence whatever he said
seemed inadequate and as if produced by a commonplace, if uneasy,
soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do&ntilde;a Rita brought her down from her mountains on
purpose.&nbsp; She is asleep somewhere in this house, in one of
the vacant rooms.&nbsp; She lets them, you know, at extortionate
prices, that is, if people will pay them, for she is easily
intimidated.&nbsp; You see, she has never seen such an enormous
town before in her life, nor yet so many strange people.&nbsp;
She has been keeping house for the uncle-priest in some mountain
gorge for years and years.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s extraordinary he
should have let her go.&nbsp; There is something mysterious
there, some reason or other.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s either theology or
Family.&nbsp; The saintly uncle in his wild parish would know
nothing of any other reasons.&nbsp; She wears a rosary at her
waist.&nbsp; Directly she had seen some real money she developed
a love of it.&nbsp; If you stay with me long enough, and I hope
you will (I really can&rsquo;t sleep), you will see her going out
to mass at half-past six; but there is nothing remarkable in her;
just a peasant woman of thirty-four or so.&nbsp; A rustic nun. .
. .&rdquo;</p>
<p>I may as well say at once that we didn&rsquo;t stay as long as
that.&nbsp; It was not that morning that I saw for the first time
Therese of the whispering lips and downcast eyes slipping out to
an early mass from the house of iniquity into the early winter
murk of the city of perdition, in a world steeped in sin.&nbsp;
No.&nbsp; It was not on that morning that I saw Do&ntilde;a
Rita&rsquo;s incredible sister with her brown, dry face, her
gliding motion, and her really nun-like dress, with a black
handkerchief enfolding her head tightly, with the two pointed
ends hanging down her back.&nbsp; Yes, nun-like enough.&nbsp; And
yet not altogether.&nbsp; People would have turned round after
her if those dartings out to the half-past six mass hadn&rsquo;t
been the only occasion on which she ventured into the impious
streets.&nbsp; She was frightened of the streets, but in a
particular way, not as if of a danger but as if of a
contamination.&nbsp; Yet she didn&rsquo;t fly back to her
mountains because at bottom she had an indomitable character, a
peasant tenacity of purpose, predatory instincts. . . .</p>
<p>No, we didn&rsquo;t remain long enough with Mr. Blunt to see
even as much as her back glide out of the house on her prayerful
errand.&nbsp; She was prayerful.&nbsp; She was terrible.&nbsp;
Her one-idead peasant mind was as inaccessible as a closed iron
safe.&nbsp; She was fatal. . . It&rsquo;s perfectly ridiculous to
confess that they all seem fatal to me now; but writing to you
like this in all sincerity I don&rsquo;t mind appearing
ridiculous.&nbsp; I suppose fatality must be expressed, embodied,
like other forces of this earth; and if so why not in such people
as well as in other more glorious or more frightful figures?</p>
<p>We remained, however, long enough to let Mr. Blunt&rsquo;s
half-hidden acrimony develop itself or prey on itself in further
talk about the man All&egrave;gre and the girl Rita.&nbsp; Mr.
Blunt, still addressing Mills with that story, passed on to what
he called the second act, the disclosure, with, what he called,
the characteristic All&egrave;gre impudence&mdash;which surpassed
the impudence of kings, millionaires, or tramps, by many
degrees&mdash;the revelation of Rita&rsquo;s existence to the
world at large.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t a very large world, but
then it was most choicely composed.&nbsp; How is one to describe
it shortly?&nbsp; In a sentence it was the world that rides in
the morning in the Bois.</p>
<p>In something less than a year and a half from the time he
found her sitting on a broken fragment of stone work buried in
the grass of his wild garden, full of thrushes, starlings, and
other innocent creatures of the air, he had given her amongst
other accomplishments the art of sitting admirably on a horse,
and directly they returned to Paris he took her out with him for
their first morning ride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I leave you to judge of the sensation,&rdquo; continued
Mr. Blunt, with a faint grimace, as though the words had an acrid
taste in his mouth.&nbsp; &ldquo;And the consternation,&rdquo; he
added venomously.&nbsp; &ldquo;Many of those men on that great
morning had some one of their womankind with them.&nbsp; But
their hats had to go off all the same, especially the hats of the
fellows who were under some sort of obligation to
All&egrave;gre.&nbsp; You would be astonished to hear the names
of people, of real personalities in the world, who, not to mince
matters, owed money to All&egrave;gre.&nbsp; And I don&rsquo;t
mean in the world of art only.&nbsp; In the first rout of the
surprise some story of an adopted daughter was set abroad
hastily, I believe.&nbsp; You know &lsquo;adopted&rsquo; with a
peculiar accent on the word&mdash;and it was plausible
enough.&nbsp; I have been told that at that time she looked
extremely youthful by his side, I mean extremely youthful in
expression, in the eyes, in the smile.&nbsp; She must have been .
. .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blunt pulled himself up short, but not so short as not to let
the confused murmur of the word &ldquo;adorable&rdquo; reach our
attentive ears.</p>
<p>The heavy Mills made a slight movement in his chair.&nbsp; The
effect on me was more inward, a strange emotion which left me
perfectly still; and for the moment of silence Blunt looked more
fatal than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand it didn&rsquo;t last very long,&rdquo; he
addressed us politely again.&nbsp; &ldquo;And no wonder!&nbsp;
The sort of talk she would have heard during that first
springtime in Paris would have put an impress on a much less
receptive personality; for of course All&egrave;gre didn&rsquo;t
close his doors to his friends and this new apparition was not of
the sort to make them keep away.&nbsp; After that first morning
she always had somebody to ride at her bridle hand.&nbsp; Old
Doyen, the sculptor, was the first to approach them.&nbsp; At
that age a man may venture on anything.&nbsp; He rides a strange
animal like a circus horse.&nbsp; Rita had spotted him out of the
corner of her eye as he passed them, putting up his enormous paw
in a still more enormous glove, airily, you know, like
this&rdquo; (Blunt waved his hand above his head), &ldquo;to
All&egrave;gre.&nbsp; He passes on.&nbsp; All at once he wheels
his fantastic animal round and comes trotting after them.&nbsp;
With the merest casual &lsquo;<i>Bonjour</i>,
All&egrave;gre&rsquo; he ranges close to her on the other side
and addresses her, hat in hand, in that booming voice of his like
a deferential roar of the sea very far away.&nbsp; His
articulation is not good, and the first words she really made out
were &lsquo;I am an old sculptor. . . Of course there is that
habit. . . But I can see you through all that. . . &rsquo;</p>
<p>He put his hat on very much on one side.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am a
great sculptor of women,&rsquo; he declared.&nbsp; &lsquo;I gave
up my life to them, poor unfortunate creatures, the most
beautiful, the wealthiest, the most loved. . . Two generations of
them. . . Just look at me full in the eyes, <i>mon
enfant</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They stared at each other.&nbsp; Do&ntilde;a Rita
confessed to me that the old fellow made her heart beat with such
force that she couldn&rsquo;t manage to smile at him.&nbsp; And
she saw his eyes run full of tears.&nbsp; He wiped them simply
with the back of his hand and went on booming faintly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Thought so.&nbsp; You are enough to make one cry.&nbsp; I
thought my artist&rsquo;s life was finished, and here you come
along from devil knows where with this young friend of mine, who
isn&rsquo;t a bad smearer of canvases&mdash;but it&rsquo;s marble
and bronze that you want. . . I shall finish my artist&rsquo;s
life with your face; but I shall want a bit of those shoulders,
too. . . You hear, All&egrave;gre, I must have a bit of her
shoulders, too.&nbsp; I can see through the cloth that they are
divine.&nbsp; If they aren&rsquo;t divine I will eat my
hat.&nbsp; Yes, I will do your head and then&mdash;<i>nunc
dimittis</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These were the first words with which the world greeted
her, or should I say civilization did; already both her native
mountains and the cavern of oranges belonged to a prehistoric
age.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you ask him to come this
afternoon?&rsquo; All&egrave;gre&rsquo;s voice suggested
gently.&nbsp; &lsquo;He knows the way to the house.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old man said with extraordinary fervour, &lsquo;Oh,
yes I will,&rsquo; pulled up his horse and they went on.&nbsp;
She told me that she could feel her heart-beats for a long
time.&nbsp; The remote power of that voice, those old eyes full
of tears, that noble and ruined face, had affected her
extraordinarily she said.&nbsp; But perhaps what affected her was
the shadow, the still living shadow of a great passion in the
man&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All&egrave;gre remarked to her calmly: &lsquo;He has
been a little mad all his life.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>
<p>Mills lowered the hands holding the extinct and even cold pipe
before his big face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m, shoot an arrow into that old man&rsquo;s
heart like this?&nbsp; But was there anything done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A terra-cotta bust, I believe.&nbsp; Good?&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; I rather think it&rsquo;s in this
house.&nbsp; A lot of things have been sent down from Paris here,
when she gave up the Pavilion.&nbsp; When she goes up now she
stays in hotels, you know.&nbsp; I imagine it is locked up in one
of these things,&rdquo; went on Blunt, pointing towards the end
of the studio where amongst the monumental presses of dark oak
lurked the shy dummy which had worn the stiff robes of the
Byzantine Empress and the amazing hat of the &ldquo;Girl,&rdquo;
rakishly.&nbsp; I wondered whether that dummy had travelled from
Paris, too, and whether with or without its head.&nbsp; Perhaps
that head had been left behind, having rolled into a corner of
some empty room in the dismantled Pavilion.&nbsp; I represented
it to myself very lonely, without features, like a turnip, with a
mere peg sticking out where the neck should have been.&nbsp; And
Mr. Blunt was talking on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are treasures behind these locked doors,
brocades, old jewels, unframed pictures, bronzes, chinoiseries,
Japoneries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He growled as much as a man of his accomplished manner and
voice could growl.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose she gave
away all that to her sister, but I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised
if that timid rustic didn&rsquo;t lay a claim to the lot for the
love of God and the good of the Church. . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;And held on with her teeth, too,&rdquo; he added
graphically.</p>
<p>Mills&rsquo; face remained grave.&nbsp; Very grave.&nbsp; I
was amused at those little venomous outbreaks of the fatal Mr.
Blunt.&nbsp; Again I knew myself utterly forgotten.&nbsp; But I
didn&rsquo;t feel dull and I didn&rsquo;t even feel sleepy.&nbsp;
That last strikes me as strange at this distance of time, in
regard of my tender years and of the depressing hour which
precedes the dawn.&nbsp; We had been drinking that straw-coloured
wine, too, I won&rsquo;t say like water (nobody would have drunk
water like that) but, well . . . and the haze of tobacco smoke
was like the blue mist of great distances seen in dreams.</p>
<p>Yes, that old sculptor was the first who joined them in the
sight of all Paris.&nbsp; It was that old glory that opened the
series of companions of those morning rides; a series which
extended through three successive Parisian spring-times and
comprised a famous physiologist, a fellow who seemed to hint that
mankind could be made immortal or at least everlastingly old; a
fashionable philosopher and psychologist who used to lecture to
enormous audiences of women with his tongue in his cheek (but
never permitted himself anything of the kind when talking to
Rita); that surly dandy Cabanel (but he only once, from mere
vanity), and everybody else at all distinguished including also a
celebrated person who turned out later to be a swindler.&nbsp;
But he was really a genius. . . All this according to Mr. Blunt,
who gave us all those details with a sort of languid zest
covering a secret irritation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apart from that, you know,&rdquo; went on Mr. Blunt,
&ldquo;all she knew of the world of men and women (I mean till
All&egrave;gre&rsquo;s death) was what she had seen of it from
the saddle two hours every morning during four months of the year
or so.&nbsp; Absolutely all, with All&egrave;gre self-denyingly
on her right hand, with that impenetrable air of
guardianship.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t touch!&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t like
his treasures to be touched unless he actually put some unique
object into your hands with a sort of triumphant murmur,
&lsquo;Look close at that.&rsquo;&nbsp; Of course I only have
heard all this.&nbsp; I am much too small a person, you
understand, to even . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>He flashed his white teeth at us most agreeably, but the upper
part of his face, the shadowed setting of his eyes, and the
slight drawing in of his eyebrows gave a fatal suggestion.&nbsp;
I thought suddenly of the definition he applied to himself:
&ldquo;<i>Am&eacute;ricain</i>, <i>catholique et
gentil-homme</i>&rdquo; completed by that startling &ldquo;I live
by my sword&rdquo; uttered in a light drawing-room tone tinged by
a flavour of mockery lighter even than air.</p>
<p>He insisted to us that the first and only time he had seen
All&egrave;gre a little close was that morning in the Bois with
his mother.&nbsp; His Majesty (whom God preserve), then not even
an active Pretender, flanked the girl, still a girl, on the other
side, the usual companion for a month past or so.&nbsp;
All&egrave;gre had suddenly taken it into his head to paint his
portrait.&nbsp; A sort of intimacy had sprung up.&nbsp; Mrs.
Blunt&rsquo;s remark was that of the two striking horsemen
All&egrave;gre looked the more kingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The son of a confounded millionaire soap-boiler,&rdquo;
commented Mr. Blunt through his clenched teeth.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
man absolutely without parentage.&nbsp; Without a single relation
in the world.&nbsp; Just a freak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That explains why he could leave all his fortune to
her,&rdquo; said Mills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The will, I believe,&rdquo; said Mr. Blunt moodily,
&ldquo;was written on a half sheet of paper, with his device of
an Assyrian bull at the head.&nbsp; What the devil did he mean by
it?&nbsp; Anyway it was the last time that she surveyed the world
of men and women from the saddle.&nbsp; Less than three months
later. . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All&egrave;gre died and. . . &rdquo; murmured Mills in
an interested manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she had to dismount,&rdquo; broke in Mr. Blunt
grimly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dismount right into the middle of it.&nbsp;
Down to the very ground, you understand.&nbsp; I suppose you can
guess what that would mean.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t know what to
do with herself.&nbsp; She had never been on the ground.&nbsp;
She . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; said Mills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even eh! eh! if you like,&rdquo; retorted Mr. Blunt, in
an unrefined tone, that made me open my eyes, which were well
opened before, still wider.</p>
<p>He turned to me with that horrible trick of his of commenting
upon Mills as though that quiet man whom I admired, whom I
trusted, and for whom I had already something resembling
affection had been as much of a dummy as that other one lurking
in the shadows, pitiful and headless in its attitude of alarmed
chastity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing escapes his penetration.&nbsp; He can perceive
a haystack at an enormous distance when he is
interested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought this was going rather too far, even to the borders
of vulgarity; but Mills remained untroubled and only reached for
his tobacco pouch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s nothing to my mother&rsquo;s
interest.&nbsp; She can never see a haystack, therefore she is
always so surprised and excited.&nbsp; Of course Do&ntilde;a Rita
was not a woman about whom the newspapers insert little
paragraphs.&nbsp; But All&egrave;gre was the sort of man.&nbsp; A
lot came out in print about him and a lot was talked in the world
about her; and at once my dear mother perceived a haystack and
naturally became unreasonably absorbed in it.&nbsp; I thought her
interest would wear out.&nbsp; But it didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; She had
received a shock and had received an impression by means of that
girl.&nbsp; My mother has never been treated with impertinence
before, and the aesthetic impression must have been of
extraordinary strength.&nbsp; I must suppose that it amounted to
a sort of moral revolution, I can&rsquo;t account for her
proceedings in any other way.&nbsp; When Rita turned up in Paris
a year and a half after All&egrave;gre&rsquo;s death some shabby
journalist (smart creature) hit upon the notion of alluding to
her as the heiress of Mr. All&egrave;gre.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
heiress of Mr. All&egrave;gre has taken up her residence again
amongst the treasures of art in that Pavilion so well known to
the &eacute;lite of the artistic, scientific, and political
world, not to speak of the members of aristocratic and even royal
families. . . &rsquo;&nbsp; You know the sort of thing.&nbsp; It
appeared first in the <i>Figaro</i>, I believe.&nbsp; And then at
the end a little phrase: &lsquo;She is alone.&rsquo;&nbsp; She
was in a fair way of becoming a celebrity of a sort.&nbsp; Daily
little allusions and that sort of thing.&nbsp; Heaven only knows
who stopped it.&nbsp; There was a rush of &lsquo;old
friends&rsquo; into that garden, enough to scare all the little
birds away.&nbsp; I suppose one or several of them, having
influence with the press, did it.&nbsp; But the gossip
didn&rsquo;t stop, and the name stuck, too, since it conveyed a
very certain and very significant sort of fact, and of course the
Venetian episode was talked about in the houses frequented by my
mother.&nbsp; It was talked about from a royalist point of view
with a kind of respect.&nbsp; It was even said that the
inspiration and the resolution of the war going on now over the
Pyrenees had come out from that head. . . Some of them talked as
if she were the guardian angel of Legitimacy.&nbsp; You know what
royalist gush is like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Blunt&rsquo;s face expressed sarcastic disgust.&nbsp;
Mills moved his head the least little bit.&nbsp; Apparently he
knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, speaking with all possible respect, it seems to
have affected my mother&rsquo;s brain.&nbsp; I was already with
the royal army and of course there could be no question of
regular postal communications with France.&nbsp; My mother hears
or overhears somewhere that the heiress of Mr. All&egrave;gre is
contemplating a secret journey.&nbsp; All the noble Salons were
full of chatter about that secret naturally.&nbsp; So she sits
down and pens an autograph: &lsquo;Madame, Informed that you are
proceeding to the place on which the hopes of all the right
thinking people are fixed, I trust to your womanly sympathy with
a mother&rsquo;s anxious feelings, etc., etc.,&rsquo; and ending
with a request to take messages to me and bring news of me. . .
The coolness of my mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Most unexpectedly Mills was heard murmuring a question which
seemed to me very odd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder how your mother addressed that
note?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment of silence ensued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly in the newspaper style, I should think,&rdquo;
retorted Mr. Blunt, with one of his grins that made me doubt the
stability of his feelings and the consistency of his outlook in
regard to his whole tale.&nbsp; &ldquo;My mother&rsquo;s maid
took it in a fiacre very late one evening to the Pavilion and
brought an answer scrawled on a scrap of paper: &lsquo;Write your
messages at once&rsquo; and signed with a big capital R.&nbsp; So
my mother sat down again to her charming writing desk and the
maid made another journey in a fiacre just before midnight; and
ten days later or so I got a letter thrust into my hand at the
<i>avanzadas</i> just as I was about to start on a night patrol,
together with a note asking me to call on the writer so that she
might allay my mother&rsquo;s anxieties by telling her how I
looked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was signed R only, but I guessed at once and nearly
fell off my horse with surprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean to say that Do&ntilde;a Rita was actually at
the Royal Headquarters lately?&rdquo; exclaimed Mills, with
evident surprise.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,
we&mdash;everybody&mdash;thought that all this affair was over
and done with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely.&nbsp; Nothing in the world could be more
done with than that episode.&nbsp; Of course the rooms in the
hotel at Tolosa were retained for her by an order from Royal
Headquarters.&nbsp; Two garret-rooms, the place was so full of
all sorts of court people; but I can assure you that for the
three days she was there she never put her head outside the
door.&nbsp; General Mongroviejo called on her officially from the
King.&nbsp; A general, not anybody of the household, you
see.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a distinct shade of the present
relation.&nbsp; He stayed just five minutes.&nbsp; Some personage
from the Foreign department at Headquarters was closeted for
about a couple of hours.&nbsp; That was of course business.&nbsp;
Then two officers from the staff came together with some
explanations or instructions to her.&nbsp; Then Baron H., a
fellow with a pretty wife, who had made so many sacrifices for
the cause, raised a great to-do about seeing her and she
consented to receive him for a moment.&nbsp; They say he was very
much frightened by her arrival, but after the interview went away
all smiles.&nbsp; Who else?&nbsp; Yes, the Archbishop came.&nbsp;
Half an hour.&nbsp; This is more than is necessary to give a
blessing, and I can&rsquo;t conceive what else he had to give
her.&nbsp; But I am sure he got something out of her.&nbsp; Two
peasants from the upper valley were sent for by military
authorities and she saw them, too.&nbsp; That friar who hangs
about the court has been in and out several times.&nbsp; Well,
and lastly, I myself.&nbsp; I got leave from the outposts.&nbsp;
That was the first time I talked to her.&nbsp; I would have gone
that evening back to the regiment, but the friar met me in the
corridor and informed me that I would be ordered to escort that
most loyal and noble lady back to the French frontier as a
personal mission of the highest honour.&nbsp; I was inclined to
laugh at him.&nbsp; He himself is a cheery and jovial person and
he laughed with me quite readily&mdash;but I got the order before
dark all right.&nbsp; It was rather a job, as the Alphonsists
were attacking the right flank of our whole front and there was
some considerable disorder there.&nbsp; I mounted her on a mule
and her maid on another.&nbsp; We spent one night in a ruined old
tower occupied by some of our infantry and got away at daybreak
under the Alphonsist shells.&nbsp; The maid nearly died of fright
and one of the troopers with us was wounded.&nbsp; To smuggle her
back across the frontier was another job but it wasn&rsquo;t my
job.&nbsp; It wouldn&rsquo;t have done for her to appear in sight
of French frontier posts in the company of Carlist
uniforms.&nbsp; She seems to have a fearless streak in her
nature.&nbsp; At one time as we were climbing a slope absolutely
exposed to artillery fire I asked her on purpose, being provoked
by the way she looked about at the scenery, &lsquo;A little
emotion, eh?&rsquo;&nbsp; And she answered me in a low voice:
&lsquo;Oh, yes!&nbsp; I am moved.&nbsp; I used to run about these
hills when I was little.&rsquo;&nbsp; And note, just then the
trooper close behind us had been wounded by a shell
fragment.&nbsp; He was swearing awfully and fighting with his
horse.&nbsp; The shells were falling around us about two to the
minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luckily the Alphonsist shells are not much better than
our own.&nbsp; But women are funny.&nbsp; I was afraid the maid
would jump down and clear out amongst the rocks, in which case we
should have had to dismount and catch her.&nbsp; But she
didn&rsquo;t do that; she sat perfectly still on her mule and
shrieked.&nbsp; Just simply shrieked.&nbsp; Ultimately we came to
a curiously shaped rock at the end of a short wooded
valley.&nbsp; It was very still there and the sunshine was
brilliant.&nbsp; I said to Do&ntilde;a Rita: &lsquo;We will have
to part in a few minutes.&nbsp; I understand that my mission ends
at this rock.&rsquo;&nbsp; And she said: &lsquo;I know this rock
well.&nbsp; This is my country.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she thanked me for bringing her there and
presently three peasants appeared, waiting for us, two youths and
one shaven old man, with a thin nose like a sword blade and
perfectly round eyes, a character well known to the whole Carlist
army.&nbsp; The two youths stopped under the trees at a distance,
but the old fellow came quite close up and gazed at her, screwing
up his eyes as if looking at the sun.&nbsp; Then he raised his
arm very slowly and took his red <i>boina</i> off his bald
head.&nbsp; I watched her smiling at him all the time.&nbsp; I
daresay she knew him as well as she knew the old rock.&nbsp; Very
old rock.&nbsp; The rock of ages&mdash;and the aged
man&mdash;landmarks of her youth.&nbsp; Then the mules started
walking smartly forward, with the three peasants striding
alongside of them, and vanished between the trees.&nbsp; These
fellows were most likely sent out by her uncle the Cura.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a peaceful scene, the morning light, the bit of
open country framed in steep stony slopes, a high peak or two in
the distance, the thin smoke of some invisible <i>caserios</i>,
rising straight up here and there.&nbsp; Far away behind us the
guns had ceased and the echoes in the gorges had died out.&nbsp;
I never knew what peace meant before. . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor since,&rdquo; muttered Mr. Blunt after a pause and
then went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;The little stone church of her uncle,
the holy man of the family, might have been round the corner of
the next spur of the nearest hill.&nbsp; I dismounted to bandage
the shoulder of my trooper.&nbsp; It was only a nasty long
scratch.&nbsp; While I was busy about it a bell began to ring in
the distance.&nbsp; The sound fell deliciously on the ear, clear
like the morning light.&nbsp; But it stopped all at once.&nbsp;
You know how a distant bell stops suddenly.&nbsp; I never knew
before what stillness meant.&nbsp; While I was wondering at it
the fellow holding our horses was moved to uplift his
voice.&nbsp; He was a Spaniard, not a Basque, and he trolled out
in Castilian that song you know,</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh bells of my native village,<br
/>
I am going away . . . good-bye!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He had a good voice.&nbsp; When the last note had floated away
I remounted, but there was a charm in the spot, something
particular and individual because while we were looking at it
before turning our horses&rsquo; heads away the singer said:
&lsquo;I wonder what is the name of this place,&rsquo; and the
other man remarked: &lsquo;Why, there is no village here,&rsquo;
and the first one insisted: &lsquo;No, I mean this spot, this
very place.&rsquo;&nbsp; The wounded trooper decided that it had
no name probably.&nbsp; But he was wrong.&nbsp; It had a
name.&nbsp; The hill, or the rock, or the wood, or the whole had
a name.&nbsp; I heard of it by chance later.&nbsp; It
was&mdash;Lastaola.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A cloud of tobacco smoke from Mills&rsquo; pipe drove between
my head and the head of Mr. Blunt, who, strange to say, yawned
slightly.&nbsp; It seemed to me an obvious affectation on the
part of that man of perfect manners, and, moreover, suffering
from distressing insomnia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is how we first met and how we first
parted,&rdquo; he said in a weary, indifferent tone.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite possible that she did see her uncle on
the way.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s perhaps on this occasion that she got
her sister to come out of the wilderness.&nbsp; I have no doubt
she had a pass from the French Government giving her the
completest freedom of action.&nbsp; She must have got it in Paris
before leaving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Blunt broke out into worldly, slightly cynical smiles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She can get anything she likes in Paris.&nbsp; She
could get a whole army over the frontier if she liked.&nbsp; She
could get herself admitted into the Foreign Office at one
o&rsquo;clock in the morning if it so pleased her.&nbsp; Doors
fly open before the heiress of Mr. All&egrave;gre.&nbsp; She has
inherited the old friends, the old connections . . . Of course,
if she were a toothless old woman . . . But, you see, she
isn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; The ushers in all the ministries bow down to
the ground therefore, and voices from the innermost sanctums take
on an eager tone when they say, &lsquo;<i>Faites
entrer</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; My mother knows something about
it.&nbsp; She has followed her career with the greatest
attention.&nbsp; And Rita herself is not even surprised.&nbsp;
She accomplishes most extraordinary things, as naturally as
buying a pair of gloves.&nbsp; People in the shops are very
polite and people in the world are like people in the
shops.&nbsp; What did she know of the world?&nbsp; She had seen
it only from the saddle.&nbsp; Oh, she will get your cargo
released for you all right.&nbsp; How will she do it? . . Well,
when it&rsquo;s done&mdash;you follow me, Mills?&mdash;when
it&rsquo;s done she will hardly know herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hardly possible that she shouldn&rsquo;t be
aware,&rdquo; Mills pronounced calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she isn&rsquo;t an idiot,&rdquo; admitted Mr.
Blunt, in the same matter-of-fact voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;But she
confessed to myself only the other day that she suffered from a
sense of unreality.&nbsp; I told her that at any rate she had her
own feelings surely.&nbsp; And she said to me: Yes, there was one
of them at least about which she had no doubt; and you will never
guess what it was.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t try.&nbsp; I happen to know,
because we are pretty good friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment we all changed our attitude slightly.&nbsp;
Mills&rsquo; staring eyes moved for a glance towards Blunt, I,
who was occupying the divan, raised myself on the cushions a
little and Mr. Blunt, with half a turn, put his elbow on the
table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked her what it was.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
see,&rdquo; went on Mr. Blunt, with a perfectly horrible
gentleness, &ldquo;why I should have shown particular
consideration to the heiress of Mr. All&egrave;gre.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t mean to that particular mood of hers.&nbsp; It was
the mood of weariness.&nbsp; And so she told me.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
fear.&nbsp; I will say it once again: Fear. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>He added after a pause, &ldquo;There can be not the slightest
doubt of her courage.&nbsp; But she distinctly uttered the word
fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was under the table the noise of Mills stretching his
legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A person of imagination,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;a
young, virgin intelligence, steeped for nearly five years in the
talk of All&egrave;gre&rsquo;s studio, where every hard truth had
been cracked and every belief had been worried into shreds.&nbsp;
They were like a lot of intellectual dogs, you know . .
.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, of course,&rdquo; Blunt interrupted hastily,
&ldquo;the intellectual personality altogether adrift, a soul
without a home . . . but I, who am neither very fine nor very
deep, I am convinced that the fear is material.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because she confessed to it being that?&rdquo;
insinuated Mills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, because she didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; contradicted
Blunt, with an angry frown and in an extremely suave voice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In fact, she bit her tongue.&nbsp; And considering what
good friends we are (under fire together and all that) I conclude
that there is nothing there to boast of.&nbsp; Neither is my
friendship, as a matter of fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mills&rsquo; face was the very perfection of
indifference.&nbsp; But I who was looking at him, in my
innocence, to discover what it all might mean, I had a notion
that it was perhaps a shade too perfect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My leave is a farce,&rdquo; Captain Blunt burst out,
with a most unexpected exasperation.&nbsp; &ldquo;As an officer
of Don Carlos, I have no more standing than a bandit.&nbsp; I
ought to have been interned in those filthy old barracks in
Avignon a long time ago. . . Why am I not?&nbsp; Because
Do&ntilde;a Rita exists and for no other reason on earth.&nbsp;
Of course it&rsquo;s known that I am about.&nbsp; She has only to
whisper over the wires to the Minister of the Interior,
&lsquo;Put that bird in a cage for me,&rsquo; and the thing would
be done without any more formalities than that. . . Sad world
this,&rdquo; he commented in a changed tone.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nowadays a gentleman who lives by his sword is exposed to
that sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was then for the first time I heard Mr. Mills laugh.&nbsp;
It was a deep, pleasant, kindly note, not very loud and
altogether free from that quality of derision that spoils so many
laughs and gives away the secret hardness of hearts.&nbsp; But
neither was it a very joyous laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the truth of the matter is that I am &lsquo;<i>en
mission</i>,&rsquo;&rdquo; continued Captain Blunt.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have been instructed to settle some things, to set other
things going, and, by my instructions, Do&ntilde;a Rita is to be
the intermediary for all those objects.&nbsp; And why?&nbsp;
Because every bald head in this Republican Government gets pink
at the top whenever her dress rustles outside the door.&nbsp;
They bow with immense deference when the door opens, but the bow
conceals a smirk because of those Venetian days.&nbsp; That
confounded Versoy shoved his nose into that business; he says
accidentally.&nbsp; He saw them together on the Lido and (those
writing fellows are horrible) he wrote what he calls a vignette
(I suppose accidentally, too) under that very title.&nbsp; There
was in it a Prince and a lady and a big dog.&nbsp; He described
how the Prince on landing from the gondola emptied his purse into
the hands of a picturesque old beggar, while the lady, a little
way off, stood gazing back at Venice with the dog romantically
stretched at her feet.&nbsp; One of Versoy&rsquo;s beautiful
prose vignettes in a great daily that has a literary
column.&nbsp; But some other papers that didn&rsquo;t care a cent
for literature rehashed the mere fact.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s the
sort of fact that impresses your political man, especially if the
lady is, well, such as she is . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused.&nbsp; His dark eyes flashed fatally, away from us,
in the direction of the shy dummy; and then he went on with
cultivated cynicism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So she rushes down here.&nbsp; Overdone, weary, rest
for her nerves.&nbsp; Nonsense.&nbsp; I assure you she has no
more nerves than I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how he meant it, but at that moment, slim
and elegant, he seemed a mere bundle of nerves himself, with the
flitting expressions on his thin, well-bred face, with the
restlessness of his meagre brown hands amongst the objects on the
table.&nbsp; With some pipe ash amongst a little spilt wine his
forefinger traced a capital R.&nbsp; Then he looked into an empty
glass profoundly.&nbsp; I have a notion that I sat there staring
and listening like a yokel at a play.&nbsp; Mills&rsquo; pipe was
lying quite a foot away in front of him, empty, cold.&nbsp;
Perhaps he had no more tobacco.&nbsp; Mr. Blunt assumed his
dandified air&mdash;nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course her movements are commented on in the most
exclusive drawing-rooms and also in other places, also exclusive,
but where the gossip takes on another tone.&nbsp; There they are
probably saying that she has got a &lsquo;<i>coup de
coeur</i>&rsquo; for some one.&nbsp; Whereas I think she is
utterly incapable of that sort of thing.&nbsp; That Venetian
affair, the beginning of it and the end of it, was nothing but a
<i>coup de t&ecirc;te</i>, and all those activities in which I am
involved, as you see (by order of Headquarters, ha, ha, ha!), are
nothing but that, all this connection, all this intimacy into
which I have dropped . . . Not to speak of my mother, who is
delightful, but as irresponsible as one of those crazy princesses
that shock their Royal families. . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>He seemed to bite his tongue and I observed that Mills&rsquo;
eyes seemed to have grown wider than I had ever seen them
before.&nbsp; In that tranquil face it was a great play of
feature.&nbsp; &ldquo;An intimacy,&rdquo; began Mr. Blunt, with
an extremely refined grimness of tone, &ldquo;an intimacy with
the heiress of Mr. All&egrave;gre on the part of . . . on my
part, well, it isn&rsquo;t exactly . . . it&rsquo;s open . . .
well, I leave it to you, what does it look like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there anybody looking on?&rdquo; Mills let fall,
gently, through his kindly lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not actually, perhaps, at this moment.&nbsp; But I
don&rsquo;t need to tell a man of the world, like you, that such
things cannot remain unseen.&nbsp; And that they are, well,
compromising, because of the mere fact of the fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mills got on his feet, looked for his jacket and after getting
into it made himself heard while he looked for his hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whereas the woman herself is, so to speak,
priceless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Blunt muttered the word &ldquo;Obviously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By then we were all on our feet.&nbsp; The iron stove glowed
no longer and the lamp, surrounded by empty bottles and empty
glasses, had grown dimmer.</p>
<p>I know that I had a great shiver on getting away from the
cushions of the divan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will meet again in a few hours,&rdquo; said Mr.
Blunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget to come,&rdquo; he said, addressing
me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, yes, do.&nbsp; Have no scruples.&nbsp; I am
authorized to make invitations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He must have noticed my shyness, my surprise, my
embarrassment.&nbsp; And indeed I didn&rsquo;t know what to
say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assure you there isn&rsquo;t anything incorrect in
your coming,&rdquo; he insisted, with the greatest
civility.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will be introduced by two good
friends, Mills and myself.&nbsp; Surely you are not afraid of a
very charming woman. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was not afraid, but my head swam a little and I only looked
at him mutely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lunch precisely at midday.&nbsp; Mills will bring you
along.&nbsp; I am sorry you two are going.&nbsp; I shall throw
myself on the bed for an hour or two, but I am sure I won&rsquo;t
sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He accompanied us along the passage into the black-and-white
hall, where the low gas flame glimmered forlornly.&nbsp; When he
opened the front door the cold blast of the mistral rushing down
the street of the Consuls made me shiver to the very marrow of my
bones.</p>
<p>Mills and I exchanged but a few words as we walked down
towards the centre of the town.&nbsp; In the chill tempestuous
dawn he strolled along musingly, disregarding the discomfort of
the cold, the depressing influence of the hour, the desolation of
the empty streets in which the dry dust rose in whirls in front
of us, behind us, flew upon us from the side streets.&nbsp; The
masks had gone home and our footsteps echoed on the flagstones
with unequal sound as of men without purpose, without hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you will come,&rdquo; said Mills
suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; Well, remember I am not trying
to persuade you; but I am staying at the H&ocirc;tel de Louvre
and I shall leave there at a quarter to twelve for that
lunch.&nbsp; At a quarter to twelve, not a minute later.&nbsp; I
suppose you can sleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charming age, yours,&rdquo; said Mills, as we came out
on the quays.&nbsp; Already dim figures of the workers moved in
the biting dawn and the masted forms of ships were coming out
dimly, as far as the eye could reach down the old harbour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Mills began again, &ldquo;you may
oversleep yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This suggestion was made in a cheerful tone, just as we shook
hands at the lower end of the Cannebi&egrave;re.&nbsp; He looked
very burly as he walked away from me.&nbsp; I went on towards my
lodgings.&nbsp; My head was very full of confused images, but I
was really too tired to think.</p>
<h2>PART TWO</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
<p>Sometimes I wonder yet whether Mills wished me to oversleep
myself or not: that is, whether he really took sufficient
interest to care.&nbsp; His uniform kindliness of manner made it
impossible for me to tell.&nbsp; And I can hardly remember my own
feelings.&nbsp; Did I care?&nbsp; The whole recollection of that
time of my life has such a peculiar quality that the beginning
and the end of it are merged in one sensation of profound
emotion, continuous and overpowering, containing the extremes of
exultation, full of careless joy and of an invincible
sadness&mdash;like a day-dream.&nbsp; The sense of all this
having been gone through as if in one great rush of imagination
is all the stronger in the distance of time, because it had
something of that quality even then: of fate unprovoked, of
events that didn&rsquo;t cast any shadow before.</p>
<p>Not that those events were in the least extraordinary.&nbsp;
They were, in truth, commonplace.&nbsp; What to my backward
glance seems startling and a little awful is their punctualness
and inevitability.&nbsp; Mills was punctual.&nbsp; Exactly at a
quarter to twelve he appeared under the lofty portal of the
H&ocirc;tel de Louvre, with his fresh face, his ill-fitting grey
suit, and enveloped in his own sympathetic atmosphere.</p>
<p>How could I have avoided him?&nbsp; To this day I have a
shadowy conviction of his inherent distinction of mind and heart,
far beyond any man I have ever met since.&nbsp; He was
unavoidable: and of course I never tried to avoid him.&nbsp; The
first sight on which his eyes fell was a victoria pulled up
before the hotel door, in which I sat with no sentiment I can
remember now but that of some slight shyness.&nbsp; He got in
without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, his friendly glance took me
in from head to foot and (such was his peculiar gift) gave me a
pleasurable sensation.</p>
<p>After we had gone a little way I couldn&rsquo;t help saying to
him with a bashful laugh: &ldquo;You know, it seems very
extraordinary that I should be driving out with you like
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to look at me and in his kind voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will find everything extremely simple,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;So simple that you will be quite able to hold
your own.&nbsp; I suppose you know that the world is selfish, I
mean the majority of the people in it, often unconsciously I must
admit, and especially people with a mission, with a fixed idea,
with some fantastic object in view, or even with only some
fantastic illusion.&nbsp; That doesn&rsquo;t mean that they have
no scruples.&nbsp; And I don&rsquo;t know that at this moment I
myself am not one of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, of course, I can&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; I
retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen her for years,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and in comparison with what she was then she must be very
grown up by now.&nbsp; From what we heard from Mr. Blunt she had
experiences which would have matured her more than they would
teach her.&nbsp; There are of course people that are not
teachable.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know that she is one of
them.&nbsp; But as to maturity that&rsquo;s quite another
thing.&nbsp; Capacity for suffering is developed in every human
being worthy of the name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Blunt doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a very happy
person,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;He seems to have a grudge
against everybody.&nbsp; People make him wince.&nbsp; The things
they do, the things they say.&nbsp; He must be awfully
mature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mills gave me a sidelong look.&nbsp; It met mine of the same
character and we both smiled without openly looking at each
other.&nbsp; At the end of the Rue de Rome the violent chilly
breath of the mistral enveloped the victoria in a great widening
of brilliant sunshine without heat.&nbsp; We turned to the right,
circling at a stately pace about the rather mean obelisk which
stands at the entrance to the Prado.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether you are mature or
not,&rdquo; said Mills humorously.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I think you
will do.&nbsp; You . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; I interrupted, &ldquo;what is really
Captain Blunt&rsquo;s position there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I nodded at the alley of the Prado opening before us
between the rows of the perfectly leafless trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thoroughly false, I should think.&nbsp; It
doesn&rsquo;t accord either with his illusions or his
pretensions, or even with the real position he has in the
world.&nbsp; And so what between his mother and the General
Headquarters and the state of his own feelings he. . .
&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is in love with her,&rdquo; I interrupted again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t make it any easier.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
not at all sure of that.&nbsp; But if so it can&rsquo;t be a very
idealistic sentiment.&nbsp; All the warmth of his idealism is
concentrated upon a certain &lsquo;<i>Am&eacute;ricain</i>,
<i>Catholique et gentil-homme</i>. . . &rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The smile which for a moment dwelt on his lips was not
unkind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the same time he has a very good grip of the
material conditions that surround, as it were, the
situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&nbsp; That Do&ntilde;a Rita&rdquo;
(the name came strangely familiar to my tongue) &ldquo;is rich,
that she has a fortune of her own?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a fortune,&rdquo; said Mills.&nbsp; &ldquo;But it
was All&egrave;gre&rsquo;s fortune before. . . And then there is
Blunt&rsquo;s fortune: he lives by his sword.&nbsp; And there is
the fortune of his mother, I assure you a perfectly charming,
clever, and most aristocratic old lady, with the most
distinguished connections.&nbsp; I really mean it.&nbsp; She
doesn&rsquo;t live by her sword.&nbsp; She . . . she lives by her
wits.&nbsp; I have a notion that those two dislike each other
heartily at times. . . Here we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The victoria stopped in the side alley, bordered by the low
walls of private grounds.&nbsp; We got out before a wrought-iron
gateway which stood half open and walked up a circular drive to
the door of a large villa of a neglected appearance.&nbsp; The
mistral howled in the sunshine, shaking the bare bushes quite
furiously.&nbsp; And everything was bright and hard, the air was
hard, the light was hard, the ground under our feet was hard.</p>
<p>The door at which Mills rang came open almost at once.&nbsp;
The maid who opened it was short, dark, and slightly
pockmarked.&nbsp; For the rest, an obvious
&ldquo;<i>femme-de-chambre</i>,&rdquo; and very busy.&nbsp; She
said quickly, &ldquo;Madame has just returned from her
ride,&rdquo; and went up the stairs leaving us to shut the front
door ourselves.</p>
<p>The staircase had a crimson carpet.&nbsp; Mr. Blunt appeared
from somewhere in the hall.&nbsp; He was in riding breeches and a
black coat with ample square skirts.&nbsp; This get-up suited him
but it also changed him extremely by doing away with the effect
of flexible slimness he produced in his evening clothes.&nbsp; He
looked to me not at all himself but rather like a brother of the
man who had been talking to us the night before.&nbsp; He carried
about him a delicate perfume of scented soap.&nbsp; He gave us a
flash of his white teeth and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a perfect nuisance.&nbsp; We have just
dismounted.&nbsp; I will have to lunch as I am.&nbsp; A lifelong
habit of beginning her day on horseback.&nbsp; She pretends she
is unwell unless she does.&nbsp; I daresay, when one thinks there
has been hardly a day for five or six years that she didn&rsquo;t
begin with a ride.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the reason she is always
rushing away from Paris where she can&rsquo;t go out in the
morning alone.&nbsp; Here, of course, it&rsquo;s different.&nbsp;
And as I, too, am a stranger here I can go out with her.&nbsp;
Not that I particularly care to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These last words were addressed to Mills specially, with the
addition of a mumbled remark: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a confounded
position.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then calmly to me with a swift smile:
&ldquo;We have been talking of you this morning.&nbsp; You are
expected with impatience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but I
can&rsquo;t help asking myself what I am doing here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The upward cast in the eyes of Mills who was facing the
staircase made us both, Blunt and I, turn round.&nbsp; The woman
of whom I had heard so much, in a sort of way in which I had
never heard a woman spoken of before, was coming down the stairs,
and my first sensation was that of profound astonishment at this
evidence that she did really exist.&nbsp; And even then the
visual impression was more of colour in a picture than of the
forms of actual life.&nbsp; She was wearing a wrapper, a sort of
dressing-gown of pale blue silk embroidered with black and gold
designs round the neck and down the front, lapped round her and
held together by a broad belt of the same material.&nbsp; Her
slippers were of the same colour, with black bows at the
instep.&nbsp; The white stairs, the deep crimson of the carpet,
and the light blue of the dress made an effective combination of
colour to set off the delicate carnation of that face, which,
after the first glance given to the whole person, drew
irresistibly your gaze to itself by an indefinable quality of
charm beyond all analysis and made you think of remote races, of
strange generations, of the faces of women sculptured on
immemorial monuments and of those lying unsung in their
tombs.&nbsp; While she moved downwards from step to step with
slightly lowered eyes there flashed upon me suddenly the
recollection of words heard at night, of All&egrave;gre&rsquo;s
words about her, of there being in her &ldquo;something of the
women of all time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the last step she raised her eyelids, treated us to an
exhibition of teeth as dazzling as Mr. Blunt&rsquo;s and looking
even stronger; and indeed, as she approached us she brought home
to our hearts (but after all I am speaking only for myself) a
vivid sense of her physical perfection in beauty of limb and
balance of nerves, and not so much of grace, probably, as of
absolute harmony.</p>
<p>She said to us, &ldquo;I am sorry I kept you
waiting.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her voice was low pitched, penetrating, and
of the most seductive gentleness.&nbsp; She offered her hand to
Mills very frankly as to an old friend.&nbsp; Within the
extraordinarily wide sleeve, lined with black silk, I could see
the arm, very white, with a pearly gleam in the shadow.&nbsp; But
to me she extended her hand with a slight stiffening, as it were
a recoil of her person, combined with an extremely straight
glance.&nbsp; It was a finely shaped, capable hand.&nbsp; I bowed
over it, and we just touched fingers.&nbsp; I did not look then
at her face.</p>
<p>Next moment she caught sight of some envelopes lying on the
round marble-topped table in the middle of the hall.&nbsp; She
seized one of them with a wonderfully quick, almost feline,
movement and tore it open, saying to us, &ldquo;Excuse me, I must
. . . Do go into the dining-room.&nbsp; Captain Blunt, show the
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her widened eyes stared at the paper.&nbsp; Mr. Blunt threw
one of the doors open, but before we passed through it we heard a
petulant exclamation accompanied by childlike stamping with both
feet and ending in a laugh which had in it a note of
contempt.</p>
<p>The door closed behind us; we had been abandoned by Mr.
Blunt.&nbsp; He had remained on the other side, possibly to
soothe.&nbsp; The room in which we found ourselves was long like
a gallery and ended in a rotunda with many windows.&nbsp; It was
long enough for two fireplaces of red polished granite.&nbsp; A
table laid out for four occupied very little space.&nbsp; The
floor inlaid in two kinds of wood in a bizarre pattern was highly
waxed, reflecting objects like still water.</p>
<p>Before very long Do&ntilde;a Rita and Blunt rejoined us and we
sat down around the table; but before we could begin to talk a
dramatically sudden ring at the front door stilled our incipient
animation.&nbsp; Do&ntilde;a Rita looked at us all in turn, with
surprise and, as it were, with suspicion.&nbsp; &ldquo;How did he
know I was here?&rdquo; she whispered after looking at the card
which was brought to her.&nbsp;&nbsp; She passed it to Blunt, who
passed it to Mills, who made a faint grimace, dropped it on the
table-cloth, and only whispered to me, &ldquo;A journalist from
Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has run me to earth,&rdquo; said Do&ntilde;a
Rita.&nbsp; &ldquo;One would bargain for peace against hard cash
if these fellows weren&rsquo;t always ready to snatch at
one&rsquo;s very soul with the other hand.&nbsp; It frightens
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice floated mysterious and penetrating from her lips,
which moved very little.&nbsp; Mills was watching her with
sympathetic curiosity.&nbsp; Mr. Blunt muttered: &ldquo;Better
not make the brute angry.&rdquo;&nbsp; For a moment Do&ntilde;a
Rita&rsquo;s face, with its narrow eyes, its wide brow, and high
cheek bones, became very still; then her colour was a little
heightened.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said softly, &ldquo;let
him come in.&nbsp; He would be really dangerous if he had a
mind&mdash;you know,&rdquo; she said to Mills.</p>
<p>The person who had provoked all those remarks and as much
hesitation as though he had been some sort of wild beast
astonished me on being admitted, first by the beauty of his white
head of hair and then by his paternal aspect and the innocent
simplicity of his manner.&nbsp; They laid a cover for him between
Mills and Do&ntilde;a Rita, who quite openly removed the
envelopes she had brought with her, to the other side of her
plate.&nbsp; As openly the man&rsquo;s round china-blue eyes
followed them in an attempt to make out the handwriting of the
addresses.</p>
<p>He seemed to know, at least slightly, both Mills and
Blunt.&nbsp; To me he gave a stare of stupid surprise.&nbsp; He
addressed our hostess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Resting?&nbsp; Rest is a very good thing.&nbsp; Upon my
word, I thought I would find you alone.&nbsp; But you have too
much sense.&nbsp; Neither man nor woman has been created to live
alone. . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; After this opening he had all the talk
to himself.&nbsp; It was left to him pointedly, and I verily
believe that I was the only one who showed an appearance of
interest.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t help it.&nbsp; The others,
including Mills, sat like a lot of deaf and dumb people.&nbsp;
No.&nbsp; It was even something more detached.&nbsp; They sat
rather like a very superior lot of waxworks, with the fixed but
indetermined facial expression and with that odd air wax figures
have of being aware of their existence being but a sham.</p>
<p>I was the exception; and nothing could have marked better my
status of a stranger, the completest possible stranger in the
moral region in which those people lived, moved, enjoying or
suffering their incomprehensible emotions.&nbsp; I was as much of
a stranger as the most hopeless castaway stumbling in the dark
upon a hut of natives and finding them in the grip of some
situation appertaining to the mentalities, prejudices, and
problems of an undiscovered country&mdash;of a country of which
he had not even had one single clear glimpse before.</p>
<p>It was even worse in a way.&nbsp; It ought to have been more
disconcerting.&nbsp; For, pursuing the image of the cast-away
blundering upon the complications of an unknown scheme of life,
it was I, the castaway, who was the savage, the simple innocent
child of nature.&nbsp; Those people were obviously more civilized
than I was.&nbsp; They had more rites, more ceremonies, more
complexity in their sensations, more knowledge of evil, more
varied meanings to the subtle phrases of their language.&nbsp;
Naturally!&nbsp; I was still so young!&nbsp; And yet I assure
you, that just then I lost all sense of inferiority.&nbsp; And
why?&nbsp; Of course the carelessness and the ignorance of youth
had something to do with that.&nbsp; But there was something else
besides.&nbsp; Looking at Do&ntilde;a Rita, her head leaning on
her hand, with her dark lashes lowered on the slightly flushed
cheek, I felt no longer alone in my youth.&nbsp; That woman of
whom I had heard these things I have set down with all the
exactness of unfailing memory, that woman was revealed to me
young, younger than anybody I had ever seen, as young as myself
(and my sensation of my youth was then very acute); revealed with
something peculiarly intimate in the conviction, as if she were
young exactly in the same way in which I felt myself young; and
that therefore no misunderstanding between us was possible and
there could be nothing more for us to know about each
other.&nbsp; Of course this sensation was momentary, but it was
illuminating; it was a light which could not last, but it left no
darkness behind.&nbsp; On the contrary, it seemed to have kindled
magically somewhere within me a glow of assurance, of
unaccountable confidence in myself: a warm, steady, and eager
sensation of my individual life beginning for good there, on that
spot, in that sense of solidarity, in that seduction.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>
<p>For this, properly speaking wonderful, reason I was the only
one of the company who could listen without constraint to the
unbidden guest with that fine head of white hair, so beautifully
kept, so magnificently waved, so artistically arranged that
respect could not be felt for it any more than for a very
expensive wig in the window of a hair-dresser.&nbsp; In fact, I
had an inclination to smile at it.&nbsp; This proves how
unconstrained I felt.&nbsp; My mind was perfectly at liberty; and
so of all the eyes in that room mine was the only pair able to
look about in easy freedom.&nbsp; All the other listeners&rsquo;
eyes were cast down, including Mills&rsquo; eyes, but that I am
sure was only because of his perfect and delicate sympathy.&nbsp;
He could not have been concerned otherwise.</p>
<p>The intruder devoured the cutlets&mdash;if they were
cutlets.&nbsp; Notwithstanding my perfect liberty of mind I was
not aware of what we were eating.&nbsp; I have a notion that the
lunch was a mere show, except of course for the man with the
white hair, who was really hungry and who, besides, must have had
the pleasant sense of dominating the situation.&nbsp; He stooped
over his plate and worked his jaw deliberately while his blue
eyes rolled incessantly; but as a matter of fact he never looked
openly at any one of us.&nbsp; Whenever he laid down his knife
and fork he would throw himself back and start retailing in a
light tone some Parisian gossip about prominent people.</p>
<p>He talked first about a certain politician of mark.&nbsp; His
&ldquo;dear Rita&rdquo; knew him.&nbsp; His costume dated back to
&rsquo;48, he was made of wood and parchment and still swathed
his neck in a white cloth; and even his wife had never been seen
in a low-necked dress.&nbsp; Not once in her life.&nbsp; She was
buttoned up to the chin like her husband.&nbsp; Well, that man
had confessed to him that when he was engaged in political
controversy, not on a matter of principle but on some special
measure in debate, he felt ready to kill everybody.</p>
<p>He interrupted himself for a comment.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am
something like that myself.&nbsp; I believe it&rsquo;s a purely
professional feeling.&nbsp; Carry one&rsquo;s point whatever it
is.&nbsp; Normally I couldn&rsquo;t kill a fly.&nbsp; My
sensibility is too acute for that.&nbsp; My heart is too tender
also.&nbsp; Much too tender.&nbsp; I am a Republican.&nbsp; I am
a Red.&nbsp; As to all our present masters and governors, all
those people you are trying to turn round your little finger,
they are all horrible Royalists in disguise.&nbsp; They are
plotting the ruin of all the institutions to which I am
devoted.&nbsp; But I have never tried to spoil your little game,
Rita.&nbsp; After all, it&rsquo;s but a little game.&nbsp; You
know very well that two or three fearless articles, something in
my style, you know, would soon put a stop to all that underhand
backing of your king.&nbsp; I am calling him king because I want
to be polite to you.&nbsp; He is an adventurer, a blood-thirsty,
murderous adventurer, for me, and nothing else.&nbsp; Look here,
my dear child, what are you knocking yourself about for?&nbsp;
For the sake of that bandit?&nbsp; <i>Allons donc</i>!&nbsp; A
pupil of Henry All&egrave;gre can have no illusions of that sort
about any man.&nbsp; And such a pupil, too!&nbsp; Ah, the good
old days in the Pavilion!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t think I claim any
particular intimacy.&nbsp; It was just enough to enable me to
offer my services to you, Rita, when our poor friend died.&nbsp;
I found myself handy and so I came.&nbsp; It so happened that I
was the first.&nbsp; You remember, Rita?&nbsp; What made it
possible for everybody to get on with our poor dear
All&egrave;gre was his complete, equable, and impartial contempt
for all mankind.&nbsp; There is nothing in that against the
purest democratic principles; but that you, Rita, should elect to
throw so much of your life away for the sake of a Royal
adventurer, it really knocks me over.&nbsp; For you don&rsquo;t
love him.&nbsp; You never loved him, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made a snatch at her hand, absolutely pulled it away from
under her head (it was quite startling) and retaining it in his
grasp, proceeded to a paternal patting of the most impudent
kind.&nbsp; She let him go on with apparent insensibility.&nbsp;
Meanwhile his eyes strayed round the table over our faces.&nbsp;
It was very trying.&nbsp; The stupidity of that wandering stare
had a paralysing power.&nbsp; He talked at large with husky
familiarity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here I come, expecting to find a good sensible girl who
had seen at last the vanity of all those things; half-light in
the rooms; surrounded by the works of her favourite poets, and
all that sort of thing.&nbsp; I say to myself: I must just run in
and see the dear wise child, and encourage her in her good
resolutions. . . And I fall into the middle of an <i>intime</i>
lunch-party.&nbsp; For I suppose it is <i>intime</i>.&nbsp;
Eh?&nbsp; Very?&nbsp; H&rsquo;m, yes . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>He was really appalling.&nbsp; Again his wandering stare went
round the table, with an expression incredibly incongruous with
the words.&nbsp; It was as though he had borrowed those eyes from
some idiot for the purpose of that visit.&nbsp; He still held
Do&ntilde;a Rita&rsquo;s hand, and, now and then, patted it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s discouraging,&rdquo; he cooed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And I believe not one of you here is a Frenchman.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know what you are all about.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s beyond
me.&nbsp; But if we were a Republic&mdash;you know I am an old
Jacobin, sans-culotte and terrorist&mdash;if this were a real
Republic with the Convention sitting and a Committee of Public
Safety attending to national business, you would all get your
heads cut off.&nbsp; Ha, ha . . . I am joking, ha, ha! . . . and
serve you right, too.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t mind my little
joke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he was still laughing he released her hand and she
leaned her head on it again without haste.&nbsp; She had never
looked at him once.</p>
<p>During the rather humiliating silence that ensued he got a
leather cigar case like a small valise out of his pocket, opened
it and looked with critical interest at the six cigars it
contained.&nbsp; The tireless <i>femme-de-chambre</i> set down a
tray with coffee cups on the table.&nbsp; We each (glad, I
suppose, of something to do) took one, but he, to begin with,
sniffed at his.&nbsp; Do&ntilde;a Rita continued leaning on her
elbow, her lips closed in a reposeful expression of peculiar
sweetness.&nbsp; There was nothing drooping in her
attitude.&nbsp; Her face with the delicate carnation of a rose
and downcast eyes was as if veiled in firm immobility and was so
appealing that I had an insane impulse to walk round and kiss the
forearm on which it was leaning; that strong, well-shaped
forearm, gleaming not like marble but with a living and warm
splendour.&nbsp; So familiar had I become already with her in my
thoughts!&nbsp; Of course I didn&rsquo;t do anything of the
sort.&nbsp; It was nothing uncontrollable, it was but a tender
longing of a most respectful and purely sentimental kind.&nbsp; I
performed the act in my thought quietly, almost solemnly, while
the creature with the silver hair leaned back in his chair,
puffing at his cigar, and began to speak again.</p>
<p>It was all apparently very innocent talk.&nbsp; He informed
his &ldquo;dear Rita&rdquo; that he was really on his way to
Monte Carlo.&nbsp; A lifelong habit of his at this time of the
year; but he was ready to run back to Paris if he could do
anything for his &ldquo;<i>ch&egrave;re enfant</i>,&rdquo; run
back for a day, for two days, for three days, for any time; miss
Monte Carlo this year altogether, if he could be of the slightest
use and save her going herself.&nbsp; For instance he could see
to it that proper watch was kept over the Pavilion stuffed with
all these art treasures.&nbsp; What was going to happen to all
those things? . . . Making herself heard for the first time
Do&ntilde;a Rita murmured without moving that she had made
arrangements with the police to have it properly watched.&nbsp;
And I was enchanted by the almost imperceptible play of her
lips.</p>
<p>But the anxious creature was not reassured.&nbsp; He pointed
out that things had been stolen out of the Louvre, which was, he
dared say, even better watched.&nbsp; And there was that
marvellous cabinet on the landing, black lacquer with silver
herons, which alone would repay a couple of burglars.&nbsp; A
wheelbarrow, some old sacking, and they could trundle it off
under people&rsquo;s noses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you thought it all out?&rdquo; she asked in a cold
whisper, while we three sat smoking to give ourselves a
countenance (it was certainly no enjoyment) and wondering what we
would hear next.</p>
<p>No, he had not.&nbsp; But he confessed that for years and
years he had been in love with that cabinet.&nbsp; And anyhow
what was going to happen to the things?&nbsp; The world was
greatly exercised by that problem.&nbsp; He turned slightly his
beautifully groomed white head so as to address Mr. Blunt
directly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had the pleasure of meeting your mother
lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Blunt took his time to raise his eyebrows and flash his
teeth at him before he dropped negligently, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
imagine where you could have met my mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, at Bing&rsquo;s, the curio-dealer,&rdquo; said the
other with an air of the heaviest possible stupidity.&nbsp; And
yet there was something in these few words which seemed to imply
that if Mr. Blunt was looking for trouble he would certainly get
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bing was bowing her out of his shop, but he was
so angry about something that he was quite rude even to me
afterwards.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s very good for
<i>Madame votre m&egrave;re</i> to quarrel with Bing.&nbsp; He is
a Parisian personality.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s quite a power in his
sphere.&nbsp; All these fellows&rsquo; nerves are upset from
worry as to what will happen to the All&egrave;gre
collection.&nbsp; And no wonder they are nervous.&nbsp; A big art
event hangs on your lips, my dear, great Rita.&nbsp; And by the
way, you too ought to remember that it isn&rsquo;t wise to
quarrel with people.&nbsp; What have you done to that poor
Azzolati?&nbsp; Did you really tell him to get out and never come
near you again, or something awful like that?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
doubt that he was of use to you or to your king.&nbsp; A man who
gets invitations to shoot with the President at
Rambouillet!&nbsp; I saw him only the other evening; I heard he
had been winning immensely at cards; but he looked perfectly
wretched, the poor fellow.&nbsp; He complained of your
conduct&mdash;oh, very much!&nbsp; He told me you had been
perfectly brutal with him.&nbsp; He said to me: &lsquo;I am no
good for anything, <i>mon cher</i>.&nbsp; The other day at
Rambouillet, whenever I had a hare at the end of my gun I would
think of her cruel words and my eyes would run full of
tears.&nbsp; I missed every shot&rsquo; . . . You are not fit for
diplomatic work, you know, <i>ma ch&egrave;re</i>.&nbsp; You are
a mere child at it.&nbsp; When you want a middle-aged gentleman
to do anything for you, you don&rsquo;t begin by reducing him to
tears.&nbsp; I should have thought any woman would have known
that much.&nbsp; A nun would have known that much.&nbsp; What do
you say?&nbsp; Shall I run back to Paris and make it up for you
with Azzolati?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waited for her answer.&nbsp; The compression of his thin
lips was full of significance.&nbsp; I was surprised to see our
hostess shake her head negatively the least bit, for indeed by
her pose, by the thoughtful immobility of her face she seemed to
be a thousand miles away from us all, lost in an infinite
reverie.</p>
<p>He gave it up.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I must be off.&nbsp; The
express for Nice passes at four o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; I will be
away about three weeks and then you shall see me again.&nbsp;
Unless I strike a run of bad luck and get cleaned out, in which
case you shall see me before then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to Mills suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will your cousin come south this year, to that
beautiful villa of his at Cannes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mills hardly deigned to answer that he didn&rsquo;t know
anything about his cousin&rsquo;s movements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A <i>grand seigneur</i> combined with a great
connoisseur,&rdquo; opined the other heavily.&nbsp; His mouth had
gone slack and he looked a perfect and grotesque imbecile under
his wig-like crop of white hair.&nbsp; Positively I thought he
would begin to slobber.&nbsp; But he attacked Blunt next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you on your way down, too?&nbsp; A little flutter.
. . It seems to me you haven&rsquo;t been seen in your usual
Paris haunts of late.&nbsp; Where have you been all this
time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know where I have been?&rdquo; said Mr.
Blunt with great precision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I only ferret out things that may be of some use to
me,&rdquo; was the unexpected reply, uttered with an air of
perfect vacancy and swallowed by Mr. Blunt in blank silence.</p>
<p>At last he made ready to rise from the table.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Think over what I have said, my dear Rita.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all over and done with,&rdquo; was
Do&ntilde;a Rita&rsquo;s answer, in a louder tone than I had ever
heard her use before.&nbsp; It thrilled me while she continued:
&ldquo;I mean, this thinking.&rdquo;&nbsp; She was back from the
remoteness of her meditation, very much so indeed.&nbsp; She rose
and moved away from the table, inviting by a sign the other to
follow her; which he did at once, yet slowly and as it were
warily.</p>
<p>It was a conference in the recess of a window.&nbsp; We three
remained seated round the table from which the dark maid was
removing the cups and the plates with brusque movements.&nbsp; I
gazed frankly at Do&ntilde;a Rita&rsquo;s profile, irregular,
animated, and fascinating in an undefinable way, at her
well-shaped head with the hair twisted high up and apparently
held in its place by a gold arrow with a jewelled shaft.&nbsp; We
couldn&rsquo;t hear what she said, but the movement of her lips
and the play of her features were full of charm, full of
interest, expressing both audacity and gentleness.&nbsp; She
spoke with fire without raising her voice.&nbsp; The man listened
round-shouldered, but seeming much too stupid to
understand.&nbsp; I could see now and then that he was speaking,
but he was inaudible.&nbsp; At one moment Do&ntilde;a Rita turned
her head to the room and called out to the maid, &ldquo;Give me
my hand-bag off the sofa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this the other was heard plainly, &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; and
then a little lower, &ldquo;You have no tact, Rita. . .
.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then came her argument in a low, penetrating voice
which I caught, &ldquo;Why not?&nbsp; Between such old
friends.&rdquo;&nbsp; However, she waved away the hand-bag, he
calmed down, and their voices sank again.&nbsp; Presently I saw
him raise her hand to his lips, while with her back to the room
she continued to contemplate out of the window the bare and
untidy garden.&nbsp; At last he went out of the room, throwing to
the table an airy &ldquo;<i>Bonjour, bonjour</i>,&rdquo; which
was not acknowledged by any of us three.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>
<p>Mills got up and approached the figure at the window.&nbsp; To
my extreme surprise, Mr. Blunt, after a moment of obviously
painful hesitation, hastened out after the man with the white
hair.</p>
<p>In consequence of these movements I was left to myself and I
began to be uncomfortably conscious of it when Do&ntilde;a Rita,
near the window, addressed me in a raised voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have no confidences to exchange, Mr. Mills and
I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I took this for an encouragement to join them.&nbsp; They were
both looking at me.&nbsp; Do&ntilde;a Rita added, &ldquo;Mr.
Mills and I are friends from old times, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bathed in the softened reflection of the sunshine, which did
not fall directly into the room, standing very straight with her
arms down, before Mills, and with a faint smile directed to me,
she looked extremely young, and yet mature.&nbsp; There was even,
for a moment, a slight dimple in her cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old, I wonder?&rdquo; I said, with an answering
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, for ages, for ages,&rdquo; she exclaimed hastily,
frowning a little, then she went on addressing herself to Mills,
apparently in continuation of what she was saying before.</p>
<p>. . .&nbsp; &ldquo;This man&rsquo;s is an extreme case, and
yet perhaps it isn&rsquo;t the worst.&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s the
sort of thing.&nbsp; I have no account to render to anybody, but
I don&rsquo;t want to be dragged along all the gutters where that
man picks up his living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had thrown her head back a little but there was no scorn,
no angry flash under the dark-lashed eyelids.&nbsp; The words did
not ring.&nbsp; I was struck for the first time by the even,
mysterious quality of her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you let me suggest,&rdquo; said Mills, with a
grave, kindly face, &ldquo;that being what you are, you have
nothing to fear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And perhaps nothing to lose,&rdquo; she went on without
bitterness.&nbsp; &ldquo;No.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t fear.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a sort of dread.&nbsp; You must remember that no nun
could have had a more protected life.&nbsp; Henry All&egrave;gre
had his greatness.&nbsp; When he faced the world he also masked
it.&nbsp; He was big enough for that.&nbsp; He filled the whole
field of vision for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You found that enough?&rdquo; asked Mills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why ask now?&rdquo; she remonstrated.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
truth&mdash;the truth is that I never asked myself.&nbsp; Enough
or not there was no room for anything else.&nbsp; He was the
shadow and the light and the form and the voice.&nbsp; He would
have it so.&nbsp; The morning he died they came to call me at
four o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; I ran into his room bare-footed.&nbsp;
He recognized me and whispered, &lsquo;You are
flawless.&rsquo;&nbsp; I was very frightened.&nbsp; He seemed to
think, and then said very plainly, &lsquo;Such is my
character.&nbsp; I am like that.&rsquo;&nbsp; These were the last
words he spoke.&nbsp; I hardly noticed them then.&nbsp; I was
thinking that he was lying in a very uncomfortable position and I
asked him if I should lift him up a little higher on the
pillows.&nbsp; You know I am very strong.&nbsp; I could have done
it.&nbsp; I had done it before.&nbsp; He raised his hand off the
blanket just enough to make a sign that he didn&rsquo;t want to
be touched.&nbsp; It was the last gesture he made.&nbsp; I hung
over him and then&mdash;and then I nearly ran out of the house
just as I was, in my night-gown.&nbsp; I think if I had been
dressed I would have run out of the garden, into the
street&mdash;run away altogether.&nbsp; I had never seen
death.&nbsp; I may say I had never heard of it.&nbsp; I wanted to
run from it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused for a long, quiet breath.&nbsp; The harmonized
sweetness and daring of her face was made pathetic by her
downcast eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Fuir la mort</i>,&rdquo; she repeated, meditatively,
in her mysterious voice.</p>
<p>Mills&rsquo; big head had a little movement, nothing
more.&nbsp; Her glance glided for a moment towards me like a
friendly recognition of my right to be there, before she began
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My life might have been described as looking at mankind
from a fourth-floor window for years.&nbsp; When the end came it
was like falling out of a balcony into the street.&nbsp; It was
as sudden as that.&nbsp; Once I remember somebody was telling us
in the Pavilion a tale about a girl who jumped down from a
fourth-floor window. . . For love, I believe,&rdquo; she
interjected very quickly, &ldquo;and came to no harm.&nbsp; Her
guardian angel must have slipped his wings under her just in
time.&nbsp; He must have.&nbsp; But as to me, all I know is that
I didn&rsquo;t break anything&mdash;not even my heart.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t be shocked, Mr. Mills.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very likely
that you don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; Mills assented, unmoved.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t be too sure of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henry All&egrave;gre had the highest opinion of your
intelligence,&rdquo; she said unexpectedly and with evident
seriousness.&nbsp; &ldquo;But all this is only to tell you that
when he was gone I found myself down there unhurt, but dazed,
bewildered, not sufficiently stunned.&nbsp; It so happened that
that creature was somewhere in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; How he
found out. . . But it&rsquo;s his business to find out
things.&nbsp; And he knows, too, how to worm his way in
anywhere.&nbsp; Indeed, in the first days he was useful and
somehow he made it look as if Heaven itself had sent him.&nbsp;
In my distress I thought I could never sufficiently repay. . .
Well, I have been paying ever since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Mills softly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In hard cash?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s really so little,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I told you it wasn&rsquo;t the worst case.&nbsp; I stayed
on in that house from which I nearly ran away in my
nightgown.&nbsp; I stayed on because I didn&rsquo;t know what to
do next.&nbsp; He vanished as he had come on the track of
something else, I suppose.&nbsp; You know he really has got to
get his living some way or other.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t think I
was deserted.&nbsp; On the contrary.&nbsp; People were coming and
going, all sorts of people that Henry All&egrave;gre used to
know&mdash;or had refused to know.&nbsp; I had a sensation of
plotting and intriguing around me, all the time.&nbsp; I was
feeling morally bruised, sore all over, when, one day, Don Rafael
de Villarel sent in his card.&nbsp; A grandee.&nbsp; I
didn&rsquo;t know him, but, as you are aware, there was hardly a
personality of mark or position that hasn&rsquo;t been talked
about in the Pavilion before me.&nbsp; Of him I had only heard
that he was a very austere and pious person, always at Mass, and
that sort of thing.&nbsp; I saw a frail little man with a long,
yellow face and sunken fanatical eyes, an Inquisitor, an
unfrocked monk.&nbsp; One missed a rosary from his thin
fingers.&nbsp; He gazed at me terribly and I couldn&rsquo;t
imagine what he might want.&nbsp; I waited for him to pull out a
crucifix and sentence me to the stake there and then.&nbsp; But
no; he dropped his eyes and in a cold, righteous sort of voice
informed me that he had called on behalf of the prince&mdash;he
called him His Majesty.&nbsp; I was amazed by the change.&nbsp; I
wondered now why he didn&rsquo;t slip his hands into the sleeves
of his coat, you know, as begging Friars do when they come for a
subscription.&nbsp; He explained that the Prince asked for
permission to call and offer me his condolences in person.&nbsp;
We had seen a lot of him our last two months in Paris that
year.&nbsp; Henry All&egrave;gre had taken a fancy to paint his
portrait.&nbsp; He used to ride with us nearly every
morning.&nbsp; Almost without thinking I said I should be
pleased.&nbsp; Don Rafael was shocked at my want of formality,
but bowed to me in silence, very much as a monk bows, from the
waist.&nbsp; If he had only crossed his hands flat on his chest
it would have been perfect.&nbsp; Then, I don&rsquo;t know why,
something moved me to make him a deep curtsy as he backed out of
the room, leaving me suddenly impressed, not only with him but
with myself too.&nbsp; I had my door closed to everybody else
that afternoon and the Prince came with a very proper sorrowful
face, but five minutes after he got into the room he was laughing
as usual, made the whole little house ring with it.&nbsp; You
know his big, irresistible laugh. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mills, a little abruptly, &ldquo;I have
never seen him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, surprised, &ldquo;and yet you . .
. &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; interrupted Mills.&nbsp;
&ldquo;All this is purely accidental.&nbsp; You must know that I
am a solitary man of books but with a secret taste for adventure
which somehow came out; surprising even me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She listened with that enigmatic, still, under the eyelids
glance, and a friendly turn of the head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you for a frank and loyal gentleman. . .
Adventure&mdash;and books?&nbsp; Ah, the books!&nbsp;
Haven&rsquo;t I turned stacks of them over!&nbsp; Haven&rsquo;t
I? . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; murmured Mills.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
what one does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put out her hand and laid it lightly on Mills&rsquo;
sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, I don&rsquo;t need to justify myself, but if I
had known a single woman in the world, if I had only had the
opportunity to observe a single one of them, I would have been
perhaps on my guard.&nbsp; But you know I hadn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; The
only woman I had anything to do with was myself, and they say
that one can&rsquo;t know oneself.&nbsp; It never entered my head
to be on my guard against his warmth and his terrible
obviousness.&nbsp; You and he were the only two, infinitely
different, people, who didn&rsquo;t approach me as if I had been
a precious object in a collection, an ivory carving or a piece of
Chinese porcelain.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why I have kept you in my
memory so well.&nbsp; Oh! you were not obvious!&nbsp; As to
him&mdash;I soon learned to regret I was not some object, some
beautiful, carved object of bone or bronze; a rare piece of
porcelain, <i>p&acirc;te dure</i>, not <i>p&acirc;te
tendre</i>.&nbsp; A pretty specimen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rare, yes.&nbsp; Even unique,&rdquo; said Mills,
looking at her steadily with a smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
don&rsquo;t try to depreciate yourself.&nbsp; You were never
pretty.&nbsp; You are not pretty.&nbsp; You are worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her narrow eyes had a mischievous gleam.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you
find such sayings in your books?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a matter of fact I have,&rdquo; said Mills, with a
little laugh, &ldquo;found this one in a book.&nbsp; It was a
woman who said that of herself.&nbsp; A woman far from common,
who died some few years ago.&nbsp; She was an actress.&nbsp; A
great artist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great! . . . Lucky person!&nbsp; She had that refuge,
that garment, while I stand here with nothing to protect me from
evil fame; a naked temperament for any wind to blow upon.&nbsp;
Yes, greatness in art is a protection.&nbsp; I wonder if there
would have been anything in me if I had tried?&nbsp; But Henry
All&egrave;gre would never let me try.&nbsp; He told me that
whatever I could achieve would never be good enough for what I
was.&nbsp; The perfection of flattery!&nbsp; Was it that he
thought I had not talent of any sort?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
possible.&nbsp; He would know.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had the idea
since that he was jealous.&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t jealous of
mankind any more than he was afraid of thieves for his
collection; but he may have been jealous of what he could see in
me, of some passion that could be aroused.&nbsp; But if so he
never repented.&nbsp; I shall never forget his last words.&nbsp;
He saw me standing beside his bed, defenceless, symbolic and
forlorn, and all he found to say was, &lsquo;Well, I am like
that.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I forgot myself in watching her.&nbsp; I had never seen
anybody speak with less play of facial muscles.&nbsp; In the
fullness of its life her face preserved a sort of
immobility.&nbsp; The words seemed to form themselves, fiery or
pathetic, in the air, outside her lips.&nbsp; Their design was
hardly disturbed; a design of sweetness, gravity, and force as if
born from the inspiration of some artist; for I had never seen
anything to come up to it in nature before or since.</p>
<p>All this was part of the enchantment she cast over me; and I
seemed to notice that Mills had the aspect of a man under a
spell.&nbsp; If he too was a captive then I had no reason to feel
ashamed of my surrender.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you know,&rdquo; she began again abruptly,
&ldquo;that I have been accustomed to all the forms of
respect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; murmured Mills, as if
involuntarily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; she reaffirmed.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
instinct may have told me that my only protection was obscurity,
but I didn&rsquo;t know how and where to find it.&nbsp; Oh, yes,
I had that instinct . . . But there were other instincts and . .
. How am I to tell you?&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know how to be on
guard against myself, either.&nbsp; Not a soul to speak to, or to
get a warning from.&nbsp; Some woman soul that would have known,
in which perhaps I could have seen my own reflection.&nbsp; I
assure you the only woman that ever addressed me directly, and
that was in writing, was . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>She glanced aside, saw Mr. Blunt returning from the hall and
added rapidly in a lowered voice,</p>
<p>&ldquo;His mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bright, mechanical smile of Mr. Blunt gleamed at us right
down the room, but he didn&rsquo;t, as it were, follow it in his
body.&nbsp; He swerved to the nearest of the two big fireplaces
and finding some cigarettes on the mantelpiece remained leaning
on his elbow in the warmth of the bright wood fire.&nbsp; I
noticed then a bit of mute play.&nbsp; The heiress of Henry
All&egrave;gre, who could secure neither obscurity nor any other
alleviation to that invidious position, looked as if she would
speak to Blunt from a distance; but in a moment the confident
eagerness of her face died out as if killed by a sudden
thought.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know then her shrinking from all
falsehood and evasion; her dread of insincerity and disloyalty of
every kind.&nbsp; But even then I felt that at the very last
moment her being had recoiled before some shadow of a
suspicion.&nbsp; And it occurred to me, too, to wonder what sort
of business Mr. Blunt could have had to transact with our odious
visitor, of a nature so urgent as to make him run out after him
into the hall?&nbsp; Unless to beat him a little with one of the
sticks that were to be found there?&nbsp; White hair so much like
an expensive wig could not be considered a serious
protection.&nbsp; But it couldn&rsquo;t have been that.&nbsp; The
transaction, whatever it was, had been much too quiet.&nbsp; I
must say that none of us had looked out of the window and that I
didn&rsquo;t know when the man did go or if he was gone at
all.&nbsp; As a matter of fact he was already far away; and I may
just as well say here that I never saw him again in my
life.&nbsp; His passage across my field of vision was like that
of other figures of that time: not to be forgotten, a little
fantastic, infinitely enlightening for my contempt, darkening for
my memory which struggles still with the clear lights and the
ugly shadows of those unforgotten days.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>
<p>It was past four o&rsquo;clock before I left the house,
together with Mills.&nbsp; Mr. Blunt, still in his riding
costume, escorted us to the very door.&nbsp; He asked us to send
him the first fiacre we met on our way to town.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible to walk in this get-up through the
streets,&rdquo; he remarked, with his brilliant smile.</p>
<p>At this point I propose to transcribe some notes I made at the
time in little black books which I have hunted up in the litter
of the past; very cheap, common little note-books that by the
lapse of years have acquired a touching dimness of aspect, the
frayed, worn-out dignity of documents.</p>
<p>Expression on paper has never been my forte.&nbsp; My life had
been a thing of outward manifestations.&nbsp; I never had been
secret or even systematically taciturn about my simple
occupations which might have been foolish but had never required
either caution or mystery.&nbsp; But in those four hours since
midday a complete change had come over me.&nbsp; For good or evil
I left that house committed to an enterprise that could not be
talked about; which would have appeared to many senseless and
perhaps ridiculous, but was certainly full of risks, and, apart
from that, commanded discretion on the ground of simple
loyalty.&nbsp; It would not only close my lips but it would to a
certain extent cut me off from my usual haunts and from the
society of my friends; especially of the light-hearted, young,
harum-scarum kind.&nbsp; This was unavoidable.&nbsp; It was
because I felt myself thrown back upon my own thoughts and
forbidden to seek relief amongst other lives&mdash;it was perhaps
only for that reason at first I started an irregular, fragmentary
record of my days.</p>
<p>I made these notes not so much to preserve the memory (one
cared not for any to-morrow then) but to help me to keep a better
hold of the actuality.&nbsp; I scribbled them on shore and I
scribbled them on the sea; and in both cases they are concerned
not only with the nature of the facts but with the intensity of
my sensations.&nbsp; It may be, too, that I learned to love the
sea for itself only at that time.&nbsp; Woman and the sea
revealed themselves to me together, as it were: two mistresses of
life&rsquo;s values.&nbsp; The illimitable greatness of the one,
the unfathomable seduction of the other working their immemorial
spells from generation to generation fell upon my heart at last:
a common fortune, an unforgettable memory of the sea&rsquo;s
formless might and of the sovereign charm in that woman&rsquo;s
form wherein there seemed to beat the pulse of divinity rather
than blood.</p>
<p>I begin here with the notes written at the end of that very
day.</p>
<p>&mdash;Parted with Mills on the quay.&nbsp; We had walked side
by side in absolute silence.&nbsp; The fact is he is too old for
me to talk to him freely.&nbsp; For all his sympathy and
seriousness I don&rsquo;t know what note to strike and I am not
at all certain what he thinks of all this.&nbsp; As we shook
hands at parting, I asked him how much longer he expected to
stay.&nbsp; And he answered me that it depended on R.&nbsp; She
was making arrangements for him to cross the frontier.&nbsp; He
wanted to see the very ground on which the Principle of
Legitimacy was actually asserting itself arms in hand.&nbsp; It
sounded to my positive mind the most fantastic thing in the
world, this elimination of personalities from what seemed but the
merest political, dynastic adventure.&nbsp; So it wasn&rsquo;t
Do&ntilde;a Rita, it wasn&rsquo;t Blunt, it wasn&rsquo;t the
Pretender with his big infectious laugh, it wasn&rsquo;t all that
lot of politicians, archbishops, and generals, of monks,
guerrilleros, and smugglers by sea and land, of dubious agents
and shady speculators and undoubted swindlers, who were pushing
their fortunes at the risk of their precious skins.&nbsp;
No.&nbsp; It was the Legitimist Principle asserting itself!&nbsp;
Well, I would accept the view but with one reservation.&nbsp; All
the others might have been merged into the idea, but I, the
latest recruit, I would not be merged in the Legitimist
Principle.&nbsp; Mine was an act of independent assertion.&nbsp;
Never before had I felt so intensely aware of my
personality.&nbsp; But I said nothing of that to Mills.&nbsp; I
only told him I thought we had better not be seen very often
together in the streets.&nbsp; He agreed.&nbsp; Hearty
handshake.&nbsp; Looked affectionately after his broad
back.&nbsp; It never occurred to him to turn his head.&nbsp; What
was I in comparison with the Principle of Legitimacy?</p>
<p>Late that night I went in search of Dominic.&nbsp; That
Mediterranean sailor was just the man I wanted.&nbsp; He had a
great experience of all unlawful things that can be done on the
seas and he brought to the practice of them much wisdom and
audacity.&nbsp; That I didn&rsquo;t know where he lived was
nothing since I knew where he loved.&nbsp; The proprietor of a
small, quiet caf&eacute; on the quay, a certain Madame
L&eacute;onore, a woman of thirty-five with an open Roman face
and intelligent black eyes, had captivated his heart years
ago.&nbsp; In that caf&eacute; with our heads close together over
a marble table, Dominic and I held an earnest and endless
confabulation while Madame L&eacute;onore, rustling a black silk
skirt, with gold earrings, with her raven hair elaborately
dressed and something nonchalant in her movements, would take
occasion, in passing to and fro, to rest her hand for a moment on
Dominic&rsquo;s shoulder.&nbsp; Later when the little caf&eacute;
had emptied itself of its habitual customers, mostly people
connected with the work of ships and cargoes, she came quietly to
sit at our table and looking at me very hard with her black,
sparkling eyes asked Dominic familiarly what had happened to his
Signorino.&nbsp; It was her name for me.&nbsp; I was
Dominic&rsquo;s Signorino.&nbsp; She knew me by no other; and our
connection has always been somewhat of a riddle to her.&nbsp; She
said that I was somehow changed since she saw me last.&nbsp; In
her rich voice she urged Dominic only to look at my eyes.&nbsp; I
must have had some piece of luck come to me either in love or at
cards, she bantered.&nbsp; But Dominic answered half in scorn
that I was not of the sort that runs after that kind of
luck.&nbsp; He stated generally that there were some young
gentlemen very clever in inventing new ways of getting rid of
their time and their money.&nbsp; However, if they needed a
sensible man to help them he had no objection himself to lend a
hand.&nbsp; Dominic&rsquo;s general scorn for the beliefs, and
activities, and abilities of upper-class people covered the
Principle of Legitimacy amply; but he could not resist the
opportunity to exercise his special faculties in a field he knew
of old.&nbsp; He had been a desperate smuggler in his younger
days.&nbsp; We settled the purchase of a fast sailing
craft.&nbsp; Agreed that it must be a balancelle and something
altogether out of the common.&nbsp; He knew of one suitable but
she was in Corsica.&nbsp; Offered to start for Bastia by
mail-boat in the morning.&nbsp; All the time the handsome and
mature Madame L&eacute;onore sat by, smiling faintly, amused at
her great man joining like this in a frolic of boys.&nbsp; She
said the last words of that evening: &ldquo;You men never grow
up,&rdquo; touching lightly the grey hair above his temple.</p>
<p>A fortnight later.</p>
<p>. . . In the afternoon to the Prado.&nbsp; Beautiful
day.&nbsp; At the moment of ringing at the door a strong emotion
of an anxious kind.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Down the length of the
dining-room in the rotunda part full of afternoon light
Do&ntilde;a R., sitting cross-legged on the divan in the attitude
of a very old idol or a very young child and surrounded by many
cushions, waves her hand from afar pleasantly surprised,
exclaiming: &ldquo;What!&nbsp; Back already!&rdquo;&nbsp; I give
her all the details and we talk for two hours across a large
brass bowl containing a little water placed between us, lighting
cigarettes and dropping them, innumerable, puffed at, yet
untasted in the overwhelming interest of the conversation.&nbsp;
Found her very quick in taking the points and very intelligent in
her suggestions.&nbsp; All formality soon vanished between us and
before very long I discovered myself sitting cross-legged, too,
while I held forth on the qualities of different Mediterranean
sailing craft and on the romantic qualifications of Dominic for
the task.&nbsp; I believe I gave her the whole history of the
man, mentioning even the existence of Madame L&eacute;onore,
since the little caf&eacute; would have to be the headquarters of
the marine part of the plot.</p>
<p>She murmured, &ldquo;<i>Ah</i>! <i>Une belle
Romaine</i>,&rdquo; thoughtfully.&nbsp; She told me that she
liked to hear people of that sort spoken of in terms of our
common humanity.&nbsp; She observed also that she wished to see
Dominic some day; to set her eyes for once on a man who could be
absolutely depended on.&nbsp; She wanted to know whether he had
engaged himself in this adventure solely for my sake.</p>
<p>I said that no doubt it was partly that.&nbsp; We had been
very close associates in the West Indies from where we had
returned together, and he had a notion that I could be depended
on, too.&nbsp; But mainly, I suppose, it was from taste.&nbsp;
And there was in him also a fine carelessness as to what he did
and a love of venturesome enterprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it
carelessness, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a measure,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Within
limits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And very soon you will get tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I do I will tell you.&nbsp; But I may also get
frightened.&nbsp; I suppose you know there are risks, I mean
apart from the risk of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for instance,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For instance, being captured, tried, and sentenced to
what they call &lsquo;the galleys,&rsquo; in Ceuta.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all this from that love for . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for Legitimacy,&rdquo; I interrupted the inquiry
lightly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But what&rsquo;s the use asking such
questions?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s like asking the veiled figure of
fate.&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t know its own mind nor its own
heart.&nbsp; It has no heart.&nbsp; But what if I were to start
asking you&mdash;who have a heart and are not veiled to my
sight?&rdquo;&nbsp; She dropped her charming adolescent head, so
firm in modelling, so gentle in expression.&nbsp; Her uncovered
neck was round like the shaft of a column.&nbsp; She wore the
same wrapper of thick blue silk.&nbsp; At that time she seemed to
live either in her riding habit or in that wrapper folded tightly
round her and open low to a point in front.&nbsp; Because of the
absence of all trimming round the neck and from the deep view of
her bare arms in the wide sleeve this garment seemed to be put
directly on her skin and gave one the impression of one&rsquo;s
nearness to her body which would have been troubling but for the
perfect unconsciousness of her manner.&nbsp; That day she carried
no barbarous arrow in her hair.&nbsp; It was parted on one side,
brushed back severely, and tied with a black ribbon, without any
bronze mist about her forehead or temple.&nbsp; This smoothness
added to the many varieties of her expression also that of
child-like innocence.</p>
<p>Great progress in our intimacy brought about unconsciously by
our enthusiastic interest in the matter of our discourse and, in
the moments of silence, by the sympathetic current of our
thoughts.&nbsp; And this rapidly growing familiarity (truly, she
had a terrible gift for it) had all the varieties of earnestness:
serious, excited, ardent, and even gay.&nbsp; She laughed in
contralto; but her laugh was never very long; and when it had
ceased, the silence of the room with the light dying in all its
many windows seemed to lie about me warmed by its vibration.</p>
<p>As I was preparing to take my leave after a longish pause into
which we had fallen as into a vague dream, she came out of it
with a start and a quiet sigh.&nbsp; She said, &ldquo;I had
forgotten myself.&rdquo;&nbsp; I took her hand and was raising it
naturally, without premeditation, when I felt suddenly the arm to
which it belonged become insensible, passive, like a stuffed
limb, and the whole woman go inanimate all over!&nbsp; Brusquely
I dropped the hand before it reached my lips; and it was so
lifeless that it fell heavily on to the divan.</p>
<p>I remained standing before her.&nbsp; She raised to me not her
eyes but her whole face, inquisitively&mdash;perhaps in
appeal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&nbsp; This isn&rsquo;t good enough for me,&rdquo; I
said.</p>
<p>The last of the light gleamed in her long enigmatic eyes as if
they were precious enamel in that shadowy head which in its
immobility suggested a creation of a distant past: immortal art,
not transient life.&nbsp; Her voice had a profound
quietness.&nbsp; She excused herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only habit&mdash;or instinct&mdash;or what
you like.&nbsp; I have had to practise that in self-defence lest
I should be tempted sometimes to cut the arm off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I remembered the way she had abandoned this very arm and hand
to the white-haired ruffian.&nbsp; It rendered me gloomy and
idiotically obstinate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very ingenious.&nbsp; But this sort of thing is of no
use to me,&rdquo; I declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make it up,&rdquo; suggested her mysterious voice,
while her shadowy figure remained unmoved, indifferent amongst
the cushions.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t stir either.&nbsp; I refused in the same low
tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; Not before you give it to me yourself some
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;some day,&rdquo; she repeated in a breath in
which there was no irony but rather hesitation, reluctance what
did I know?</p>
<p>I walked away from the house in a curious state of gloomy
satisfaction with myself.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>And this is the last extract.&nbsp; A month afterwards.</p>
<p>&mdash;This afternoon going up to the Villa I was for the
first time accompanied in my way by some misgivings.&nbsp;
To-morrow I sail.</p>
<p>First trip and therefore in the nature of a trial trip; and I
can&rsquo;t overcome a certain gnawing emotion, for it is a trip
that <i>mustn&rsquo;t</i> fail.&nbsp; In that sort of enterprise
there is no room for mistakes.&nbsp; Of all the individuals
engaged in it will every one be intelligent enough, faithful
enough, bold enough?&nbsp; Looking upon them as a whole it seems
impossible; but as each has got only a limited part to play they
may be found sufficient each for his particular trust.&nbsp; And
will they be all punctual, I wonder?&nbsp; An enterprise that
hangs on the punctuality of many people, no matter how well
disposed and even heroic, hangs on a thread.&nbsp; This I have
perceived to be also the greatest of Dominic&rsquo;s
concerns.&nbsp; He, too, wonders.&nbsp; And when he breathes his
doubts the smile lurking under the dark curl of his moustaches is
not reassuring.</p>
<p>But there is also something exciting in such speculations and
the road to the Villa seemed to me shorter than ever before.</p>
<p>Let in by the silent, ever-active, dark lady&rsquo;s maid, who
is always on the spot and always on the way somewhere else,
opening the door with one hand, while she passes on, turning on
one for a moment her quick, black eyes, which just miss being
lustrous, as if some one had breathed on them lightly.</p>
<p>On entering the long room I perceive Mills established in an
armchair which he had dragged in front of the divan.&nbsp; I do
the same to another and there we sit side by side facing R.,
tenderly amiable yet somehow distant among her cushions, with an
immemorial seriousness in her long, shaded eyes and her fugitive
smile hovering about but never settling on her lips.&nbsp; Mills,
who is just back from over the frontier, must have been asking R.
whether she had been worried again by her devoted friend with the
white hair.&nbsp; At least I concluded so because I found them
talking of the heart-broken Azzolati.&nbsp; And after having
answered their greetings I sit and listen to Rita addressing
Mills earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I assure you Azzolati had done nothing to me.&nbsp;
I knew him.&nbsp; He was a frequent visitor at the Pavilion,
though I, personally, never talked with him very much in Henry
All&egrave;gre&rsquo;s lifetime.&nbsp; Other men were more
interesting, and he himself was rather reserved in his manner to
me.&nbsp; He was an international politician and
financier&mdash;a nobody.&nbsp; He, like many others, was
admitted only to feed and amuse Henry All&egrave;gre&rsquo;s
scorn of the world, which was insatiable&mdash;I tell
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mills.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can
imagine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I know.&nbsp; Often when we were alone Henry
All&egrave;gre used to pour it into my ears.&nbsp; If ever
anybody saw mankind stripped of its clothes as the child sees the
king in the German fairy tale, it&rsquo;s I!&nbsp; Into my
ears!&nbsp; A child&rsquo;s!&nbsp; Too young to die of
fright.&nbsp; Certainly not old enough to understand&mdash;or
even to believe.&nbsp; But then his arm was about me.&nbsp; I
used to laugh, sometimes.&nbsp; Laugh!&nbsp; At this
destruction&mdash;at these ruins!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mills, very steady before her
fire.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you have at your service the everlasting
charm of life; you are a part of the indestructible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I? . . . But there is no arm about me now.&nbsp; The
laugh!&nbsp; Where is my laugh?&nbsp; Give me back my laugh. . .
.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she laughed a little on a low note.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
know about Mills, but the subdued shadowy vibration of it echoed
in my breast which felt empty for a moment and like a large space
that makes one giddy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The laugh is gone out of my heart, which at any rate
used to feel protected.&nbsp; That feeling&rsquo;s gone,
too.&nbsp; And I myself will have to die some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Mills in an unaltered
voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;As to this body you . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a very poor
jest.&nbsp; Change from body to body as travellers used to change
horses at post houses.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve heard of this before. . .
.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt you have,&rdquo; Mills put on a
submissive air.&nbsp; &ldquo;But are we to hear any more about
Azzolati?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall.&nbsp; Listen.&nbsp; I had heard that he was
invited to shoot at Rambouillet&mdash;a quiet party, not one of
these great shoots.&nbsp; I hear a lot of things.&nbsp; I wanted
to have a certain information, also certain hints conveyed to a
diplomatic personage who was to be there, too.&nbsp; A personage
that would never let me get in touch with him though I had tried
many times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Incredible!&rdquo; mocked Mills solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The personage mistrusts his own susceptibility.&nbsp;
Born cautious,&rdquo; explained Do&ntilde;a Rita crisply with the
slightest possible quiver of her lips.&nbsp; &ldquo;Suddenly I
had the inspiration to make use of Azzolati, who had been
reminding me by a constant stream of messages that he was an old
friend.&nbsp; I never took any notice of those pathetic appeals
before.&nbsp; But in this emergency I sat down and wrote a note
asking him to come and dine with me in my hotel.&nbsp; I suppose
you know I don&rsquo;t live in the Pavilion.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t
bear the Pavilion now.&nbsp; When I have to go there I begin to
feel after an hour or so that it is haunted.&nbsp; I seem to
catch sight of somebody I know behind columns, passing through
doorways, vanishing here and there.&nbsp; I hear light footsteps
behind closed doors. . . My own!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes, her half-parted lips, remained fixed till Mills
suggested softly, &ldquo;Yes, but Azzolati.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her rigidity vanished like a flake of snow in the
sunshine.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh! Azzolati.&nbsp; It was a most solemn
affair.&nbsp; It had occurred to me to make a very elaborate
toilet.&nbsp; It was most successful.&nbsp; Azzolati looked
positively scared for a moment as though he had got into the
wrong suite of rooms.&nbsp; He had never before seen me <i>en
toilette</i>, you understand.&nbsp; In the old days once out of
my riding habit I would never dress.&nbsp; I draped myself, you
remember, Monsieur Mills.&nbsp; To go about like that suited my
indolence, my longing to feel free in my body, as at that time
when I used to herd goats. . . But never mind.&nbsp; My aim was
to impress Azzolati.&nbsp; I wanted to talk to him
seriously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was something whimsical in the quick beat of her eyelids
and in the subtle quiver of her lips.&nbsp; &ldquo;And behold!
the same notion had occurred to Azzolati.&nbsp; Imagine that for
this t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te dinner the creature had got
himself up as if for a reception at court.&nbsp; He displayed a
brochette of all sorts of decorations on the lapel of his
<i>frac</i> and had a broad ribbon of some order across his shirt
front.&nbsp; An orange ribbon.&nbsp; Bavarian, I should
say.&nbsp; Great Roman Catholic, Azzolati.&nbsp; It was always
his ambition to be the banker of all the Bourbons in the
world.&nbsp; The last remnants of his hair were dyed jet black
and the ends of his moustache were like knitting needles.&nbsp;
He was disposed to be as soft as wax in my hands.&nbsp;
Unfortunately I had had some irritating interviews during the
day.&nbsp; I was keeping down sudden impulses to smash a glass,
throw a plate on the floor, do something violent to relieve my
feelings.&nbsp; His submissive attitude made me still more
nervous.&nbsp; He was ready to do anything in the world for me
providing that I would promise him that he would never find my
door shut against him as long as he lived.&nbsp; You understand
the impudence of it, don&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; And his tone was
positively abject, too.&nbsp; I snapped back at him that I had no
door, that I was a nomad.&nbsp; He bowed ironically till his nose
nearly touched his plate but begged me to remember that to his
personal knowledge I had four houses of my own about the
world.&nbsp; And you know this made me feel a homeless outcast
more than ever&mdash;like a little dog lost in the
street&mdash;not knowing where to go.&nbsp; I was ready to cry
and there the creature sat in front of me with an imbecile smile
as much as to say &lsquo;here is a poser for you. . .
.&rsquo;&nbsp; I gnashed my teeth at him.&nbsp; Quietly, you know
. . . I suppose you two think that I am stupid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused as if expecting an answer but we made no sound and
she continued with a remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have days like that.&nbsp; Often one must listen to
false protestations, empty words, strings of lies all day long,
so that in the evening one is not fit for anything, not even for
truth if it comes in one&rsquo;s way.&nbsp; That idiot treated me
to a piece of brazen sincerity which I couldn&rsquo;t
stand.&nbsp; First of all he began to take me into his
confidence; he boasted of his great affairs, then started
groaning about his overstrained life which left him no time for
the amenities of existence, for beauty, or sentiment, or any sort
of ease of heart.&nbsp; His heart!&nbsp; He wanted me to
sympathize with his sorrows.&nbsp; Of course I ought to have
listened.&nbsp; One must pay for service.&nbsp; Only I was
nervous and tired.&nbsp; He bored me.&nbsp; I told him at last
that I was surprised that a man of such immense wealth should
still keep on going like this reaching for more and more.&nbsp; I
suppose he must have been sipping a good deal of wine while we
talked and all at once he let out an atrocity which was too much
for me.&nbsp; He had been moaning and sentimentalizing but then
suddenly he showed me his fangs.&nbsp; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; he
cries, &lsquo;you can&rsquo;t imagine what a satisfaction it is
to feel all that penniless, beggarly lot of the dear, honest,
meritorious poor wriggling and slobbering under one&rsquo;s
boots.&rsquo;&nbsp; You may tell me that he is a contemptible
animal anyhow, but you should have heard the tone!&nbsp; I felt
my bare arms go cold like ice.&nbsp; A moment before I had been
hot and faint with sheer boredom.&nbsp; I jumped up from the
table, rang for Rose, and told her to bring me my fur
cloak.&nbsp; He remained in his chair leering at me
curiously.&nbsp; When I had the fur on my shoulders and the girl
had gone out of the room I gave him the surprise of his
life.&nbsp; &lsquo;Take yourself off instantly,&rsquo; I
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Go trample on the poor if you like but never
dare speak to me again.&rsquo;&nbsp; At this he leaned his head
on his arm and sat so long at the table shading his eyes with his
hand that I had to ask, calmly&mdash;you know&mdash;whether he
wanted me to have him turned out into the corridor.&nbsp; He
fetched an enormous sigh.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have only tried to be
honest with you, Rita.&rsquo;&nbsp; But by the time he got to the
door he had regained some of his impudence.&nbsp; &lsquo;You know
how to trample on a poor fellow, too,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But I don&rsquo;t mind being made to wriggle under your
pretty shoes, Rita.&nbsp; I forgive you.&nbsp; I thought you were
free from all vulgar sentimentalism and that you had a more
independent mind.&nbsp; I was mistaken in you, that&rsquo;s
all.&rsquo;&nbsp; With that he pretends to dash a tear from his
eye-crocodile!&mdash;and goes out, leaving me in my fur by the
blazing fire, my teeth going like castanets. . . Did you ever
hear of anything so stupid as this affair?&rdquo; she concluded
in a tone of extreme candour and a profound unreadable stare that
went far beyond us both.&nbsp; And the stillness of her lips was
so perfect directly she ceased speaking that I wondered whether
all this had come through them or only had formed itself in my
mind.</p>
<p>Presently she continued as if speaking for herself only.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like taking the lids off boxes and seeing
ugly toads staring at you.&nbsp; In every one.&nbsp; Every
one.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what it is having to do with men more
than mere&mdash;Good-morning&mdash;Good evening.&nbsp; And if you
try to avoid meddling with their lids, some of them will take
them off themselves.&nbsp; And they don&rsquo;t even know, they
don&rsquo;t even suspect what they are showing you.&nbsp; Certain
confidences&mdash;they don&rsquo;t see it&mdash;are the bitterest
kind of insult.&nbsp; I suppose Azzolati imagines himself a noble
beast of prey.&nbsp; Just as some others imagine themselves to be
most delicate, noble, and refined gentlemen.&nbsp; And as likely
as not they would trade on a woman&rsquo;s troubles&mdash;and in
the end make nothing of that either.&nbsp; Idiots!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The utter absence of all anger in this spoken meditation gave
it a character of touching simplicity.&nbsp; And as if it had
been truly only a meditation we conducted ourselves as though we
had not heard it.&nbsp; Mills began to speak of his experiences
during his visit to the army of the Legitimist King.&nbsp; And I
discovered in his speeches that this man of books could be
graphic and picturesque.&nbsp; His admiration for the devotion
and bravery of the army was combined with the greatest distaste
for what he had seen of the way its great qualities were
misused.&nbsp; In the conduct of this great enterprise he had
seen a deplorable levity of outlook, a fatal lack of decision, an
absence of any reasoned plan.</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel that you of all people, Do&ntilde;a Rita, ought
to be told the truth.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know exactly what you
have at stake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was rosy like some impassive statue in a desert in the
flush of the dawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not my heart,&rdquo; she said quietly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
must believe that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do.&nbsp; Perhaps it would have been better if you. .
. &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, <i>Monsieur le Philosophe</i>.&nbsp; It would not
have been better.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t make that serious face at
me,&rdquo; she went on with tenderness in a playful note, as if
tenderness had been her inheritance of all time and playfulness
the very fibre of her being.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose you think
that a woman who has acted as I did and has not staked her heart
on it is . . . How do you know to what the heart responds as it
beats from day to day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t judge you.&nbsp; What am I before the
knowledge you were born to?&nbsp; You are as old as the
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She accepted this with a smile.&nbsp; I who was innocently
watching them was amazed to discover how much a fleeting thing
like that could hold of seduction without the help of any other
feature and with that unchanging glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With me it is <i>pun d&rsquo;onor</i>.&nbsp; To my
first independent friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were soon parted,&rdquo; ventured Mills, while I
sat still under a sense of oppression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think for a moment that I have been scared
off,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is they who were
frightened.&nbsp; I suppose you heard a lot of Headquarters
gossip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; Mills said meaningly.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
fair and the dark are succeeding each other like leaves blown in
the wind dancing in and out.&nbsp; I suppose you have noticed
that leaves blown in the wind have a look of
happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that sort of leaf is
dead.&nbsp; Then why shouldn&rsquo;t it look happy?&nbsp; And so
I suppose there is no uneasiness, no occasion for fears amongst
the &lsquo;responsibles.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon the whole not.&nbsp; Now and then a leaf seems as
if it would stick.&nbsp; There is for instance Madame . .
.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t want to know, I understand it all, I
am as old as the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mills thoughtfully, &ldquo;you are not
a leaf, you might have been a tornado yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;there was a time
that they thought I could carry him off, away from them
all&mdash;beyond them all.&nbsp; Verily, I am not very proud of
their fears.&nbsp; There was nothing reckless there worthy of a
great passion.&nbsp; There was nothing sad there worthy of a
great tenderness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is <i>this</i> the word of the Venetian
riddle?&rdquo; asked Mills, fixing her with his keen eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it pleases you to think so, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; she
said indifferently.&nbsp; The movement of her eyes, their veiled
gleam became mischievous when she asked, &ldquo;And Don Juan
Blunt, have you seen him over there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy he avoided me.&nbsp; Moreover, he is always
with his regiment at the outposts.&nbsp; He is a most valorous
captain.&nbsp; I heard some people describe him as
foolhardy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he needn&rsquo;t seek death,&rdquo; she said in an
indefinable tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;I mean as a refuge.&nbsp; There
will be nothing in his life great enough for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are angry.&nbsp; You miss him, I believe,
Do&ntilde;a Rita.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Angry?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; Weary.&nbsp; But of course
it&rsquo;s very inconvenient.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t very well ride
out alone.&nbsp; A solitary amazon swallowing the dust and the
salt spray of the Corniche promenade would attract too much
attention.&nbsp; And then I don&rsquo;t mind you two knowing that
I am afraid of going out alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid?&rdquo; we both exclaimed together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You men are extraordinary.&nbsp; Why do you want me to
be courageous?&nbsp; Why shouldn&rsquo;t I be afraid?&nbsp; Is it
because there is no one in the world to care what would happen to
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a deep-down vibration in her tone for the first
time.&nbsp; We had not a word to say.&nbsp; And she added after a
long silence:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a very good reason.&nbsp; There is a
danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With wonderful insight Mills affirmed at once:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something ugly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded slightly several times.&nbsp; Then Mills said with
conviction:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; Then it can&rsquo;t be anything in
yourself.&nbsp; And if so . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>I was moved to extravagant advice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should come out with me to sea then.&nbsp; There
may be some danger there but there&rsquo;s nothing ugly to
fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave me a startled glance quite unusual with her, more
than wonderful to me; and suddenly as though she had seen me for
the first time she exclaimed in a tone of compunction:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; And there is this one, too!&nbsp; Why!&nbsp;
Oh, why should he run his head into danger for those things that
will all crumble into dust before long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said: &ldquo;<i>You</i> won&rsquo;t crumble into
dust.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Mills chimed in:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That young enthusiast will always have his
sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were all standing up now.&nbsp; She kept her eyes on me,
and repeated with a sort of whimsical enviousness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sea!&nbsp; The violet sea&mdash;and he is longing
to rejoin it! . . . At night!&nbsp; Under the stars! . . . A
lovers&rsquo; meeting,&rdquo; she went on, thrilling me from head
to foot with those two words, accompanied by a wistful smile
pointed by a suspicion of mockery.&nbsp; She turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, Monsieur Mills?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going back to my books,&rdquo; he declared with a
very serious face.&nbsp; &ldquo;My adventure is over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Each one to his love,&rdquo; she bantered us
gently.&nbsp; &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I love books, too, at one
time!&nbsp; They seemed to contain all wisdom and hold a magic
power, too.&nbsp; Tell me, Monsieur Mills, have you found amongst
them in some black-letter volume the power of foretelling a poor
mortal&rsquo;s destiny, the power to look into the future?&nbsp;
Anybody&rsquo;s future . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; Mills shook his head. .
. &ldquo;What, not even mine?&rdquo; she coaxed as if she really
believed in a magic power to be found in books.</p>
<p>Mills shook his head again.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, I have not the
power,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am no more a great
magician, than you are a poor mortal.&nbsp; You have your ancient
spells.&nbsp; You are as old as the world.&nbsp; Of us two
it&rsquo;s you that are more fit to foretell the future of the
poor mortals on whom you happen to cast your eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words she cast her eyes down and in the moment of
deep silence I watched the slight rising and falling of her
breast.&nbsp; Then Mills pronounced distinctly: &ldquo;Good-bye,
old Enchantress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They shook hands cordially.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good-bye, poor
Magician,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Mills made as if to speak but seemed to think better of
it.&nbsp; Do&ntilde;a Rita returned my distant bow with a slight,
charmingly ceremonious inclination of her body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bon voyage</i> and a happy return,&rdquo; she said
formally.</p>
<p>I was following Mills through the door when I heard her voice
behind us raised in recall:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a moment . . . I forgot . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>I turned round.&nbsp; The call was for me, and I walked slowly
back wondering what she could have forgotten.&nbsp; She waited in
the middle of the room with lowered head, with a mute gleam in
her deep blue eyes.&nbsp; When I was near enough she extended to
me without a word her bare white arm and suddenly pressed the
back of her hand against my lips.&nbsp; I was too startled to
seize it with rapture.&nbsp; It detached itself from my lips and
fell slowly by her side.&nbsp; We had made it up and there was
nothing to say.&nbsp; She turned away to the window and I hurried
out of the room.</p>
<h2>PART THREE</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
<p>It was on our return from that first trip that I took Dominic
up to the Villa to be presented to Do&ntilde;a Rita.&nbsp; If she
wanted to look on the embodiment of fidelity, resource, and
courage, she could behold it all in that man.&nbsp; Apparently
she was not disappointed.&nbsp; Neither was Dominic
disappointed.&nbsp; During the half-hour&rsquo;s interview they
got into touch with each other in a wonderful way as if they had
some common and secret standpoint in life.&nbsp; Maybe it was
their common lawlessness, and their knowledge of things as old as
the world.&nbsp; Her seduction, his recklessness, were both
simple, masterful and, in a sense, worthy of each other.</p>
<p>Dominic was, I won&rsquo;t say awed by this interview.&nbsp;
No woman could awe Dominic.&nbsp; But he was, as it were,
rendered thoughtful by it, like a man who had not so much an
experience as a sort of revelation vouchsafed to him.&nbsp;
Later, at sea, he used to refer to La Se&ntilde;ora in a
particular tone and I knew that henceforth his devotion was not
for me alone.&nbsp; And I understood the inevitability of it
extremely well.&nbsp; As to Do&ntilde;a Rita she, after Dominic
left the room, had turned to me with animation and said:
&ldquo;But he is perfect, this man.&rdquo;&nbsp; Afterwards she
often asked after him and used to refer to him in
conversation.&nbsp; More than once she said to me: &ldquo;One
would like to put the care of one&rsquo;s personal safety into
the hands of that man.&nbsp; He looks as if he simply
couldn&rsquo;t fail one.&rdquo;&nbsp; I admitted that this was
very true, especially at sea.&nbsp; Dominic couldn&rsquo;t
fail.&nbsp; But at the same time I rather chaffed Rita on her
preoccupation as to personal safety that so often cropped up in
her talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One would think you were a crowned head in a
revolutionary world,&rdquo; I used to tell her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be different.&nbsp; One would be standing
then for something, either worth or not worth dying for.&nbsp;
One could even run away then and be done with it.&nbsp; But I
can&rsquo;t run away unless I got out of my skin and left that
behind.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you understand?&nbsp; You are very
stupid . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; But she had the grace to add, &ldquo;On
purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about the on purpose.&nbsp; I am not
certain about the stupidity.&nbsp; Her words bewildered one often
and bewilderment is a sort of stupidity.&nbsp; I remedied it by
simply disregarding the sense of what she said.&nbsp; The sound
was there and also her poignant heart-gripping presence giving
occupation enough to one&rsquo;s faculties.&nbsp; In the power of
those things over one there was mystery enough.&nbsp; It was more
absorbing than the mere obscurity of her speeches.&nbsp; But I
daresay she couldn&rsquo;t understand that.</p>
<p>Hence, at times, the amusing outbreaks of temper in word and
gesture that only strengthened the natural, the invincible force
of the spell.&nbsp; Sometimes the brass bowl would get upset or
the cigarette box would fly up, dropping a shower of cigarettes
on the floor.&nbsp; We would pick them up, re-establish
everything, and fall into a long silence, so close that the sound
of the first word would come with all the pain of a
separation.</p>
<p>It was at that time, too, that she suggested I should take up
my quarters in her house in the street of the Consuls.&nbsp;
There were certain advantages in that move.&nbsp; In my present
abode my sudden absences might have been in the long run subject
to comment.&nbsp; On the other hand, the house in the street of
Consuls was a known out-post of Legitimacy.&nbsp; But then it was
covered by the occult influence of her who was referred to in
confidential talks, secret communications, and discreet whispers
of Royalist salons as: &ldquo;Madame de Lastaola.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was the name which the heiress of Henry All&egrave;gre
had decided to adopt when, according to her own expression, she
had found herself precipitated at a moment&rsquo;s notice into
the crowd of mankind.&nbsp; It is strange how the death of Henry
All&egrave;gre, which certainly the poor man had not planned,
acquired in my view the character of a heartless desertion.&nbsp;
It gave one a glimpse of amazing egoism in a sentiment to which
one could hardly give a name, a mysterious appropriation of one
human being by another as if in defiance of unexpressed things
and for an unheard-of satisfaction of an inconceivable
pride.&nbsp; If he had hated her he could not have flung that
enormous fortune more brutally at her head.&nbsp; And his
unrepentant death seemed to lift for a moment the curtain on
something lofty and sinister like an Olympian&rsquo;s
caprice.</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Rita said to me once with humorous resignation:
&ldquo;You know, it appears that one must have a name.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s what Henry All&egrave;gre&rsquo;s man of business
told me.&nbsp; He was quite impatient with me about it.&nbsp; But
my name, <i>amigo</i>, Henry All&egrave;gre had taken from me
like all the rest of what I had been once.&nbsp; All that is
buried with him in his grave.&nbsp; It wouldn&rsquo;t have been
true.&nbsp; That is how I felt about it.&nbsp; So I took that
one.&rdquo;&nbsp; She whispered to herself:
&ldquo;Lastaola,&rdquo; not as if to test the sound but as if in
a dream.</p>
<p>To this day I am not quite certain whether it was the name of
any human habitation, a lonely <i>caserio</i> with a half-effaced
carving of a coat of arms over its door, or of some hamlet at the
dead end of a ravine with a stony slope at the back.&nbsp; It
might have been a hill for all I know or perhaps a stream.&nbsp;
A wood, or perhaps a combination of all these: just a bit of the
earth&rsquo;s surface.&nbsp; Once I asked her where exactly it
was situated and she answered, waving her hand cavalierly at the
dead wall of the room: &ldquo;Oh, over there.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
thought that this was all that I was going to hear but she added
moodily, &ldquo;I used to take my goats there, a dozen or so of
them, for the day.&nbsp; From after my uncle had said his Mass
till the ringing of the evening bell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I saw suddenly the lonely spot, sketched for me some time ago
by a few words from Mr. Blunt, populated by the agile, bearded
beasts with cynical heads, and a little misty figure dark in the
sunlight with a halo of dishevelled rust-coloured hair about its
head.</p>
<p>The epithet of rust-coloured comes from her.&nbsp; It was
really tawny.&nbsp; Once or twice in my hearing she had referred
to &ldquo;my rust-coloured hair&rdquo; with laughing
vexation.&nbsp; Even then it was unruly, abhorring the restraints
of civilization, and often in the heat of a dispute getting into
the eyes of Madame de Lastaola, the possessor of coveted art
treasures, the heiress of Henry All&egrave;gre.&nbsp; She
proceeded in a reminiscent mood, with a faint flash of gaiety all
over her face, except her dark blue eyes that moved so seldom out
of their fixed scrutiny of things invisible to other human
beings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The goats were very good.&nbsp; We clambered amongst
the stones together.&nbsp; They beat me at that game.&nbsp; I
used to catch my hair in the bushes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your rust-coloured hair,&rdquo; I whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was always this colour.&nbsp; And I used to
leave bits of my frock on thorns here and there.&nbsp; It was
pretty thin, I can tell you.&nbsp; There wasn&rsquo;t much at
that time between my skin and the blue of the sky.&nbsp; My legs
were as sunburnt as my face; but really I didn&rsquo;t tan very
much.&nbsp; I had plenty of freckles though.&nbsp; There were no
looking-glasses in the Presbytery but uncle had a piece not
bigger than my two hands for his shaving.&nbsp; One Sunday I
crept into his room and had a peep at myself.&nbsp; And
wasn&rsquo;t I startled to see my own eyes looking at me!&nbsp;
But it was fascinating, too.&nbsp; I was about eleven years old
then, and I was very friendly with the goats, and I was as shrill
as a cicada and as slender as a match.&nbsp; Heavens!&nbsp; When
I overhear myself speaking sometimes, or look at my limbs, it
doesn&rsquo;t seem to be possible.&nbsp; And yet it is the same
one.&nbsp; I do remember every single goat.&nbsp; They were very
clever.&nbsp; Goats are no trouble really; they don&rsquo;t
scatter much.&nbsp; Mine never did even if I had to hide myself
out of their sight for ever so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was but natural to ask her why she wanted to hide, and she
uttered vaguely what was rather a comment on my question:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was like fate.&rdquo;&nbsp; But I chose to take it
otherwise, teasingly, because we were often like a pair of
children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, really,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you talk like a
pagan.&nbsp; What could you know of fate at that time?&nbsp; What
was it like?&nbsp; Did it come down from Heaven?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be stupid.&nbsp; It used to come along a
cart-track that was there and it looked like a boy.&nbsp;
Wasn&rsquo;t he a little devil though.&nbsp; You understand, I
couldn&rsquo;t know that.&nbsp; He was a wealthy cousin of
mine.&nbsp; Round there we are all related, all cousins&mdash;as
in Brittany.&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t much bigger than myself but he
was older, just a boy in blue breeches and with good shoes on his
feet, which of course interested and impressed me.&nbsp; He
yelled to me from below, I screamed to him from above, he came up
and sat down near me on a stone, never said a word, let me look
at him for half an hour before he condescended to ask me who I
was.&nbsp; And the airs he gave himself!&nbsp; He quite
intimidated me sitting there perfectly dumb.&nbsp; I remember
trying to hide my bare feet under the edge of my skirt as I sat
below him on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>C&rsquo;est comique</i>, <i>eh</i>!&rdquo; she
interrupted herself to comment in a melancholy tone.&nbsp; I
looked at her sympathetically and she went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was the only son from a rich farmhouse two miles
down the slope.&nbsp; In winter they used to send him to school
at Tolosa.&nbsp; He had an enormous opinion of himself; he was
going to keep a shop in a town by and by and he was about the
most dissatisfied creature I have ever seen.&nbsp; He had an
unhappy mouth and unhappy eyes and he was always wretched about
something: about the treatment he received, about being kept in
the country and chained to work.&nbsp; He was moaning and
complaining and threatening all the world, including his father
and mother.&nbsp; He used to curse God, yes, that boy, sitting
there on a piece of rock like a wretched little Prometheus with a
sparrow pecking at his miserable little liver.&nbsp; And the
grand scenery of mountains all round, ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed in contralto: a penetrating sound with something
generous in it; not infectious, but in others provoking a
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I, poor little animal, I didn&rsquo;t know
what to make of it, and I was even a little frightened.&nbsp; But
at first because of his miserable eyes I was sorry for him,
almost as much as if he had been a sick goat.&nbsp; But,
frightened or sorry, I don&rsquo;t know how it is, I always
wanted to laugh at him, too, I mean from the very first day when
he let me admire him for half an hour.&nbsp; Yes, even then I had
to put my hand over my mouth more than once for the sake of good
manners, you understand.&nbsp; And yet, you know, I was never a
laughing child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day he came up and sat down very dignified a little
bit away from me and told me he had been thrashed for wandering
in the hills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;To be with me?&rsquo; I asked.&nbsp; And he
said: &lsquo;To be with you!&nbsp; No.&nbsp; My people
don&rsquo;t know what I do.&rsquo;&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t tell why,
but I was annoyed.&nbsp; So instead of raising a clamour of pity
over him, which I suppose he expected me to do, I asked him if
the thrashing hurt very much.&nbsp; He got up, he had a switch in
his hand, and walked up to me, saying, &lsquo;I will soon show
you.&rsquo;&nbsp; I went stiff with fright; but instead of
slashing at me he dropped down by my side and kissed me on the
cheek.&nbsp; Then he did it again, and by that time I was gone
dead all over and he could have done what he liked with the
corpse but he left off suddenly and then I came to life again and
I bolted away.&nbsp; Not very far.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t leave
the goats altogether.&nbsp; He chased me round and about the
rocks, but of course I was too quick for him in his nice town
boots.&nbsp; When he got tired of that game he started throwing
stones.&nbsp; After that he made my life very lively for
me.&nbsp; Sometimes he used to come on me unawares and then I had
to sit still and listen to his miserable ravings, because he
would catch me round the waist and hold me very tight.&nbsp; And
yet, I often felt inclined to laugh.&nbsp; But if I caught sight
of him at a distance and tried to dodge out of the way he would
start stoning me into a shelter I knew of and then sit outside
with a heap of stones at hand so that I daren&rsquo;t show the
end of my nose for hours.&nbsp; He would sit there and rave and
abuse me till I would burst into a crazy laugh in my hole; and
then I could see him through the leaves rolling on the ground and
biting his fists with rage.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t he hate me!&nbsp;
At the same time I was often terrified.&nbsp; I am convinced now
that if I had started crying he would have rushed in and perhaps
strangled me there.&nbsp; Then as the sun was about to set he
would make me swear that I would marry him when I was grown
up.&nbsp; &lsquo;Swear, you little wretched beggar,&rsquo; he
would yell to me.&nbsp; And I would swear.&nbsp; I was hungry,
and I didn&rsquo;t want to be made black and blue all over with
stones.&nbsp; Oh, I swore ever so many times to be his
wife.&nbsp; Thirty times a month for two months.&nbsp; I
couldn&rsquo;t help myself.&nbsp; It was no use complaining to my
sister Therese.&nbsp; When I showed her my bruises and tried to
tell her a little about my trouble she was quite
scandalized.&nbsp; She called me a sinful girl, a shameless
creature.&nbsp; I assure you it puzzled my head so that, between
Therese my sister and Jos&eacute; the boy, I lived in a state of
idiocy almost.&nbsp; But luckily at the end of the two months
they sent him away from home for good.&nbsp; Curious story to
happen to a goatherd living all her days out under God&rsquo;s
eye, as my uncle the Cura might have said.&nbsp; My sister
Therese was keeping house in the Presbytery.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a
terrible person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard of your sister Therese,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you have!&nbsp; Of my big sister Therese, six, ten
years older than myself perhaps?&nbsp; She just comes a little
above my shoulder, but then I was always a long thing.&nbsp; I
never knew my mother.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t even know how she
looked.&nbsp; There are no paintings or photographs in our
farmhouses amongst the hills.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t even heard
her described to me.&nbsp; I believe I was never good enough to
be told these things.&nbsp; Therese decided that I was a lump of
wickedness, and now she believes that I will lose my soul
altogether unless I take some steps to save it.&nbsp; Well, I
have no particular taste that way.&nbsp; I suppose it is annoying
to have a sister going fast to eternal perdition, but there are
compensations.&nbsp; The funniest thing is that it&rsquo;s
Therese, I believe, who managed to keep me out of the Presbytery
when I went out of my way to look in on them on my return from my
visit to the <i>Quartel Real</i> last year.&nbsp; I
couldn&rsquo;t have stayed much more than half an hour with them
anyway, but still I would have liked to get over the old
doorstep.&nbsp; I am certain that Therese persuaded my uncle to
go out and meet me at the bottom of the hill.&nbsp; I saw the old
man a long way off and I understood how it was.&nbsp; I
dismounted at once and met him on foot.&nbsp; We had half an hour
together walking up and down the road.&nbsp; He is a peasant
priest, he didn&rsquo;t know how to treat me.&nbsp; And of course
I was uncomfortable, too.&nbsp; There wasn&rsquo;t a single goat
about to keep me in countenance.&nbsp; I ought to have embraced
him.&nbsp; I was always fond of the stern, simple old man.&nbsp;
But he drew himself up when I approached him and actually took
off his hat to me.&nbsp; So simple as that!&nbsp; I bowed my head
and asked for his blessing.&nbsp; And he said &lsquo;I would
never refuse a blessing to a good Legitimist.&rsquo;&nbsp; So
stern as that!&nbsp; And when I think that I was perhaps the only
girl of the family or in the whole world that he ever in his
priest&rsquo;s life patted on the head!&nbsp; When I think of
that I . . . I believe at that moment I was as wretched as he was
himself.&nbsp; I handed him an envelope with a big red seal which
quite startled him.&nbsp; I had asked the Marquis de Villarel to
give me a few words for him, because my uncle has a great
influence in his district; and the Marquis penned with his own
hand some compliments and an inquiry about the spirit of the
population.&nbsp; My uncle read the letter, looked up at me with
an air of mournful awe, and begged me to tell his excellency that
the people were all for God, their lawful King and their old
privileges.&nbsp; I said to him then, after he had asked me about
the health of His Majesty in an awfully gloomy tone&mdash;I said
then: &lsquo;There is only one thing that remains for me to do,
uncle, and that is to give you two pounds of the very best snuff
I have brought here for you.&rsquo;&nbsp; What else could I have
got for the poor old man?&nbsp; I had no trunks with me.&nbsp; I
had to leave behind a spare pair of shoes in the hotel to make
room in my little bag for that snuff.&nbsp; And fancy!&nbsp; That
old priest absolutely pushed the parcel away.&nbsp; I could have
thrown it at his head; but I thought suddenly of that hard,
prayerful life, knowing nothing of any ease or pleasure in the
world, absolutely nothing but a pinch of snuff now and
then.&nbsp; I remembered how wretched he used to be when he
lacked a copper or two to get some snuff with.&nbsp; My face was
hot with indignation, but before I could fly out at him I
remembered how simple he was.&nbsp; So I said with great dignity
that as the present came from the King and as he wouldn&rsquo;t
receive it from my hand there was nothing else for me to do but
to throw it into the brook; and I made as if I were going to do
it, too.&nbsp; He shouted: &lsquo;Stay, unhappy girl!&nbsp; Is it
really from His Majesty, whom God preserve?&rsquo;&nbsp; I said
contemptuously, &lsquo;Of course.&rsquo;&nbsp; He looked at me
with great pity in his eyes, sighed deeply, and took the little
tin from my hand.&nbsp; I suppose he imagined me in my abandoned
way wheedling the necessary cash out of the King for the purchase
of that snuff.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t imagine how simple he
is.&nbsp; Nothing was easier than to deceive him; but don&rsquo;t
imagine I deceived him from the vainglory of a mere sinner.&nbsp;
I lied to the dear man, simply because I couldn&rsquo;t bear the
idea of him being deprived of the only gratification his big,
ascetic, gaunt body ever knew on earth.&nbsp; As I mounted my
mule to go away he murmured coldly: &lsquo;God guard you,
Se&ntilde;ora!&rsquo;&nbsp; Se&ntilde;ora!&nbsp; What
sternness!&nbsp; We were off a little way already when his heart
softened and he shouted after me in a terrible voice: &lsquo;The
road to Heaven is repentance!&rsquo;&nbsp; And then, after a
silence, again the great shout &lsquo;Repentance!&rsquo;
thundered after me.&nbsp; Was that sternness or simplicity, I
wonder?&nbsp; Or a mere unmeaning superstition, a mechanical
thing?&nbsp; If there lives anybody completely honest in this
world, surely it must be my uncle.&nbsp; And yet&mdash;who
knows?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you guess what was the next thing I did?&nbsp;
Directly I got over the frontier I wrote from Bayonne asking the
old man to send me out my sister here.&nbsp; I said it was for
the service of the King.&nbsp; You see, I had thought suddenly of
that house of mine in which you once spent the night talking with
Mr. Mills and Don Juan Blunt.&nbsp; I thought it would do
extremely well for Carlist officers coming this way on leave or
on a mission.&nbsp; In hotels they might have been molested, but
I knew that I could get protection for my house.&nbsp; Just a
word from the ministry in Paris to the Prefect.&nbsp; But I
wanted a woman to manage it for me.&nbsp; And where was I to find
a trustworthy woman?&nbsp; How was I to know one when I saw
her?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know how to talk to women.&nbsp; Of
course my Rose would have done for me that or anything else; but
what could I have done myself without her?&nbsp; She has looked
after me from the first.&nbsp; It was Henry All&egrave;gre who
got her for me eight years ago.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know whether
he meant it for a kindness but she&rsquo;s the only human being
on whom I can lean.&nbsp; She knows . . . What doesn&rsquo;t she
know about me!&nbsp; She has never failed to do the right thing
for me unasked.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t part with her.&nbsp; And I
couldn&rsquo;t think of anybody else but my sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all it was somebody belonging to me.&nbsp; But it
seemed the wildest idea.&nbsp; Yet she came at once.&nbsp; Of
course I took care to send her some money.&nbsp; She likes
money.&nbsp; As to my uncle there is nothing that he
wouldn&rsquo;t have given up for the service of the King.&nbsp;
Rose went to meet her at the railway station.&nbsp; She told me
afterwards that there had been no need for me to be anxious about
her recognizing Mademoiselle Therese.&nbsp; There was nobody else
in the train that could be mistaken for her.&nbsp; I should think
not!&nbsp; She had made for herself a dress of some brown stuff
like a nun&rsquo;s habit and had a crooked stick and carried all
her belongings tied up in a handkerchief.&nbsp; She looked like a
pilgrim to a saint&rsquo;s shrine.&nbsp; Rose took her to the
house.&nbsp; She asked when she saw it: &lsquo;And does this big
place really belong to our Rita?&rsquo;&nbsp; My maid of course
said that it was mine.&nbsp; &lsquo;And how long did our Rita
live here?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Madame has never seen it unless
perhaps the outside, as far as I know.&nbsp; I believe Mr.
All&egrave;gre lived here for some time when he was a young
man.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;The sinner that&rsquo;s
dead?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Just so,&rsquo; says Rose.&nbsp; You
know nothing ever startles Rose.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, his sins are
gone with him,&rsquo; said my sister, and began to make herself
at home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rose was going to stop with her for a week but on the
third day she was back with me with the remark that Mlle. Therese
knew her way about very well already and preferred to be left to
herself.&nbsp; Some little time afterwards I went to see that
sister of mine.&nbsp; The first thing she said to me, &lsquo;I
wouldn&rsquo;t have recognized you, Rita,&rsquo; and I said,
&lsquo;What a funny dress you have, Therese, more fit for the
portress of a convent than for this
house.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and
unless you give this house to me, Rita, I will go back to our
country.&nbsp; I will have nothing to do with your life,
Rita.&nbsp; Your life is no secret for me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going from room to room and Therese was following
me.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know that my life is a secret to
anybody,&rsquo; I said to her, &lsquo;but how do you know
anything about it?&rsquo;&nbsp; And then she told me that it was
through a cousin of ours, that horrid wretch of a boy, you
know.&nbsp; He had finished his schooling and was a clerk in a
Spanish commercial house of some kind, in Paris, and apparently
had made it his business to write home whatever he could hear
about me or ferret out from those relations of mine with whom I
lived as a girl.&nbsp; I got suddenly very furious.&nbsp; I raged
up and down the room (we were alone upstairs), and Therese
scuttled away from me as far as the door.&nbsp; I heard her say
to herself, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the evil spirit in her that makes
her like this.&rsquo;&nbsp; She was absolutely convinced of
that.&nbsp; She made the sign of the cross in the air to protect
herself.&nbsp; I was quite astounded.&nbsp; And then I really
couldn&rsquo;t help myself.&nbsp; I burst into a laugh.&nbsp; I
laughed and laughed; I really couldn&rsquo;t stop till Therese
ran away.&nbsp; I went downstairs still laughing and found her in
the hall with her face to the wall and her fingers in her ears
kneeling in a corner.&nbsp; I had to pull her out by the
shoulders from there.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think she was
frightened; she was only shocked.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t suppose
her heart is desperately bad, because when I dropped into a chair
feeling very tired she came and knelt in front of me and put her
arms round my waist and entreated me to cast off from me my evil
ways with the help of saints and priests.&nbsp; Quite a little
programme for a reformed sinner.&nbsp; I got away at last.&nbsp;
I left her sunk on her heels before the empty chair looking after
me.&nbsp; &lsquo;I pray for you every night and morning,
Rita,&rsquo; she said.&mdash;&lsquo;Oh, yes.&nbsp; I know you are
a good sister,&rsquo; I said to her.&nbsp; I was letting myself
out when she called after me, &lsquo;And what about this house,
Rita?&rsquo;&nbsp; I said to her, &lsquo;Oh, you may keep it till
the day I reform and enter a convent.&rsquo;&nbsp; The last I saw
of her she was still on her knees looking after me with her mouth
open.&nbsp; I have seen her since several times, but our
intercourse is, at any rate on her side, as of a frozen nun with
some great lady.&nbsp; But I believe she really knows how to make
men comfortable.&nbsp; Upon my word I think she likes to look
after men.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t seem to be such great sinners
as women are.&nbsp; I think you could do worse than take up your
quarters at number 10.&nbsp; She will no doubt develop a saintly
sort of affection for you, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that the prospect of becoming a favourite
of Do&ntilde;a Rita&rsquo;s peasant sister was very fascinating
to me.&nbsp; If I went to live very willingly at No. 10 it was
because everything connected with Do&ntilde;a Rita had for me a
peculiar fascination.&nbsp; She had only passed through the house
once as far as I knew; but it was enough.&nbsp; She was one of
those beings that leave a trace.&nbsp; I am not
unreasonable&mdash;I mean for those that knew her.&nbsp; That is,
I suppose, because she was so unforgettable.&nbsp; Let us
remember the tragedy of Azzolati the ruthless, the ridiculous
financier with a criminal soul (or shall we say heart) and facile
tears.&nbsp; No wonder, then, that for me, who may flatter myself
without undue vanity with being much finer than that grotesque
international intriguer, the mere knowledge that Do&ntilde;a Rita
had passed through the very rooms in which I was going to live
between the strenuous times of the sea-expeditions, was enough to
fill my inner being with a great content.&nbsp; Her glance, her
darkly brilliant blue glance, had run over the walls of that room
which most likely would be mine to slumber in.&nbsp; Behind me,
somewhere near the door, Therese, the peasant sister, said in a
funnily compassionate tone and in an amazingly
landlady-of-a-boarding-house spirit of false persuasiveness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will be very comfortable here, Se&ntilde;or.&nbsp;
It is so peaceful here in the street.&nbsp; Sometimes one may
think oneself in a village.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s only a hundred and
twenty-five francs for the friends of the King.&nbsp; And I shall
take such good care of you that your very heart will be able to
rest.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Rita was curious to know how I got on with her
peasant sister and all I could say in return for that inquiry was
that the peasant sister was in her own way amiable.&nbsp; At this
she clicked her tongue amusingly and repeated a remark she had
made before: &ldquo;She likes young men.&nbsp; The younger the
better.&rdquo;&nbsp; The mere thought of those two women being
sisters aroused one&rsquo;s wonder.&nbsp; Physically they were
altogether of different design.&nbsp; It was also the difference
between living tissue of glowing loveliness with a divine breath,
and a hard hollow figure of baked clay.</p>
<p>Indeed Therese did somehow resemble an achievement, wonderful
enough in its way, in unglazed earthenware.&nbsp; The only gleam
perhaps that one could find on her was that of her teeth, which
one used to get between her dull lips unexpectedly, startlingly,
and a little inexplicably, because it was never associated with a
smile.&nbsp; She smiled with compressed mouth.&nbsp; It was
indeed difficult to conceive of those two birds coming from the
same nest.&nbsp; And yet . . . Contrary to what generally
happens, it was when one saw those two women together that one
lost all belief in the possibility of their relationship near or
far.&nbsp; It extended even to their common humanity.&nbsp; One,
as it were, doubted it.&nbsp; If one of the two was
representative, then the other was either something more or less
than human.&nbsp; One wondered whether these two women belonged
to the same scheme of creation.&nbsp; One was secretly amazed to
see them standing together, speaking to each other, having words
in common, understanding each other.&nbsp; And yet! . . . Our
psychological sense is the crudest of all; we don&rsquo;t know,
we don&rsquo;t perceive how superficial we are.&nbsp; The
simplest shades escape us, the secret of changes, of
relations.&nbsp; No, upon the whole, the only feature (and yet
with enormous differences) which Therese had in common with her
sister, as I told Do&ntilde;a Rita, was amiability.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For, you know, you are a most amiable person
yourself,&rdquo; I went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of your
characteristics, of course much more precious than in other
people.&nbsp; You transmute the commonest traits into gold of
your own; but after all there are no new names.&nbsp; You are
amiable.&nbsp; You were most amiable to me when I first saw
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really.&nbsp; I was not aware.&nbsp; Not specially . .
. &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had never the presumption to think that it was
special.&nbsp; Moreover, my head was in a whirl.&nbsp; I was lost
in astonishment first of all at what I had been listening to all
night.&nbsp; Your history, you know, a wonderful tale with a
flavour of wine in it and wreathed in clouds, with that amazing
decapitated, mutilated dummy of a woman lurking in a corner, and
with Blunt&rsquo;s smile gleaming through a fog, the fog in my
eyes, from Mills&rsquo; pipe, you know.&nbsp; I was feeling quite
inanimate as to body and frightfully stimulated as to mind all
the time.&nbsp; I had never heard anything like that talk about
you before.&nbsp; Of course I wasn&rsquo;t sleepy, but still I am
not used to do altogether without sleep like Blunt . .
.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kept awake all night listening to my
story!&rdquo;&nbsp; She marvelled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t think I am complaining, do
you?&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t have missed it for the world.&nbsp;
Blunt in a ragged old jacket and a white tie and that incisive
polite voice of his seemed strange and weird.&nbsp; It seemed as
though he were inventing it all rather angrily.&nbsp; I had
doubts as to your existence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Blunt is very much interested in my
story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody would be,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
was.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t sleep a wink.&nbsp; I was expecting to
see you soon&mdash;and even then I had my doubts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to my existence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t exactly that, though of course I
couldn&rsquo;t tell that you weren&rsquo;t a product of Captain
Blunt&rsquo;s sleeplessness.&nbsp; He seemed to dread exceedingly
to be left alone and your story might have been a device to
detain us . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t enough imagination for that,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t occur to me.&nbsp; But there was Mills,
who apparently believed in your existence.&nbsp; I could trust
Mills.&nbsp; My doubts were about the propriety.&nbsp; I
couldn&rsquo;t see any good reason for being taken to see
you.&nbsp; Strange that it should be my connection with the sea
which brought me here to the Villa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unexpected perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; I mean particularly strange and
significant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because my friends are in the habit of telling me (and
each other) that the sea is my only love.&nbsp; They were always
chaffing me because they couldn&rsquo;t see or guess in my life
at any woman, open or secret. . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is that really so?&rdquo; she inquired
negligently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mean to say that I am
like an innocent shepherd in one of those interminable stories of
the eighteenth century.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t throw the word
love about indiscriminately.&nbsp; It may be all true about the
sea; but some people would say that they love
sausages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are horrible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am surprised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean your choice of words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have never uttered a word yet that didn&rsquo;t
change into a pearl as it dropped from your lips.&nbsp; At least
not before me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She glanced down deliberately and said, &ldquo;This is
better.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t see any of them on the
floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you who are horrible in the implications of
your language.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t see any on the floor!&nbsp;
Haven&rsquo;t I caught up and treasured them all in my
heart?&nbsp; I am not the animal from which sausages are
made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at me suavely and then with the sweetest possible
smile breathed out the word: &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And we both laughed very loud.&nbsp; O! days of
innocence!&nbsp; On this occasion we parted from each other on a
light-hearted note.&nbsp; But already I had acquired the
conviction that there was nothing more lovable in the world than
that woman; nothing more life-giving, inspiring, and illuminating
than the emanation of her charm.&nbsp; I meant it
absolutely&mdash;not excepting the light of the sun.</p>
<p>From this there was only one step further to take.&nbsp; The
step into a conscious surrender; the open perception that this
charm, warming like a flame, was also all-revealing like a great
light; giving new depth to shades, new brilliance to colours, an
amazing vividness to all sensations and vitality to all thoughts:
so that all that had been lived before seemed to have been lived
in a drab world and with a languid pulse.</p>
<p>A great revelation this.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mean to say it
was soul-shaking.&nbsp; The soul was already a captive before
doubt, anguish, or dismay could touch its surrender and its
exaltation.&nbsp; But all the same the revelation turned many
things into dust; and, amongst others, the sense of the careless
freedom of my life.&nbsp; If that life ever had any purpose or
any aim outside itself I would have said that it threw a shadow
across its path.&nbsp; But it hadn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; There had been
no path.&nbsp; But there was a shadow, the inseparable companion
of all light.&nbsp; No illumination can sweep all mystery out of
the world.&nbsp; After the departed darkness the shadows remain,
more mysterious because as if more enduring; and one feels a
dread of them from which one was free before.&nbsp; What if they
were to be victorious at the last?&nbsp; They, or what perhaps
lurks in them: fear, deception, desire, disillusion&mdash;all
silent at first before the song of triumphant love vibrating in
the light.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Silent.&nbsp; Even desire
itself!&nbsp; All silent.&nbsp; But not for long!</p>
<p>This was, I think, before the third expedition.&nbsp; Yes, it
must have been the third, for I remember that it was boldly
planned and that it was carried out without a hitch.&nbsp; The
tentative period was over; all our arrangements had been
perfected.&nbsp; There was, so to speak, always an unfailing
smoke on the hill and an unfailing lantern on the shore.&nbsp;
Our friends, mostly bought for hard cash and therefore valuable,
had acquired confidence in us.&nbsp; This, they seemed to say, is
no unfathomable roguery of penniless adventurers.&nbsp; This is
but the reckless enterprise of men of wealth and sense and
needn&rsquo;t be inquired into.&nbsp; The young <i>caballero</i>
has got real gold pieces in the belt he wears next his skin; and
the man with the heavy moustaches and unbelieving eyes is indeed
very much of a man.&nbsp; They gave to Dominic all their respect
and to me a great show of deference; for I had all the money,
while they thought that Dominic had all the sense.&nbsp; That
judgment was not exactly correct.&nbsp; I had my share of
judgment and audacity which surprises me now that the years have
chilled the blood without dimming the memory.&nbsp; I remember
going about the business with light-hearted, clear-headed
recklessness which, according as its decisions were sudden or
considered, made Dominic draw his breath through his clenched
teeth, or look hard at me before he gave me either a slight nod
of assent or a sarcastic &ldquo;Oh, certainly&rdquo;&mdash;just
as the humour of the moment prompted him.</p>
<p>One night as we were lying on a bit of dry sand under the lee
of a rock, side by side, watching the light of our little vessel
dancing away at sea in the windy distance, Dominic spoke suddenly
to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose Alphonso and Carlos, Carlos and Alphonso,
they are nothing to you, together or separately?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said: &ldquo;Dominic, if they were both to vanish from the
earth together or separately it would make no difference to my
feelings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He remarked: &ldquo;Just so.&nbsp; A man mourns only for his
friends.&nbsp; I suppose they are no more friends to you than
they are to me.&nbsp; Those Carlists make a great consumption of
cartridges.&nbsp; That is well.&nbsp; But why should we do all
those mad things that you will insist on us doing till my
hair,&rdquo; he pursued with grave, mocking exaggeration,
&ldquo;till my hair tries to stand up on my head? and all for
that Carlos, let God and the devil each guard his own, for that
Majesty as they call him, but after all a man like another
and&mdash;no friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, why?&rdquo; I murmured, feeling my body nestled at
ease in the sand.</p>
<p>It was very dark under the overhanging rock on that night of
clouds and of wind that died and rose and died again.&nbsp;
Dominic&rsquo;s voice was heard speaking low between the short
gusts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friend of the Se&ntilde;ora, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what the world says, Dominic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half of what the world says are lies,&rdquo; he
pronounced dogmatically.&nbsp; &ldquo;For all his majesty he may
be a good enough man.&nbsp; Yet he is only a king in the
mountains and to-morrow he may be no more than you.&nbsp; Still a
woman like that&mdash;one, somehow, would grudge her to a better
king.&nbsp; She ought to be set up on a high pillar for people
that walk on the ground to raise their eyes up to.&nbsp; But you
are otherwise, you gentlemen.&nbsp; You, for instance, Monsieur,
you wouldn&rsquo;t want to see her set up on a pillar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sort of thing, Dominic,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that
sort of thing, you understand me, ought to be done
early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was silent for a time.&nbsp; And then his manly voice was
heard in the shadow of the rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see well enough what you mean.&nbsp; I spoke of the
multitude, that only raise their eyes.&nbsp; But for kings and
suchlike that is not enough.&nbsp; Well, no heart need despair;
for there is not a woman that wouldn&rsquo;t at some time or
other get down from her pillar for no bigger bribe perhaps than
just a flower which is fresh to-day and withered to-morrow.&nbsp;
And then, what&rsquo;s the good of asking how long any woman has
been up there?&nbsp; There is a true saying that lips that have
been kissed do not lose their freshness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what answer I could have made.&nbsp; I
imagine Dominic thought himself unanswerable.&nbsp; As a matter
of fact, before I could speak, a voice came to us down the face
of the rock crying secretly, &ldquo;Ol&agrave;, down there!&nbsp;
All is safe ashore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the boy who used to hang about the stable of a
muleteer&rsquo;s inn in a little shallow valley with a shallow
little stream in it, and where we had been hiding most of the day
before coming down to the shore.&nbsp; We both started to our
feet and Dominic said, &ldquo;A good boy that.&nbsp; You
didn&rsquo;t hear him either come or go above our heads.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t reward him with more than one peseta, Se&ntilde;or,
whatever he does.&nbsp; If you were to give him two he would go
mad at the sight of so much wealth and throw up his job at the
Fonda, where he is so useful to run errands, in that way he has
of skimming along the paths without displacing a
stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meantime he was busying himself with striking a fire to set
alight a small heap of dry sticks he had made ready beforehand on
that spot which in all the circuit of the Bay was perfectly
screened from observation from the land side.</p>
<p>The clear flame shooting up revealed him in the black cloak
with a hood of a Mediterranean sailor.&nbsp; His eyes watched the
dancing dim light to seaward.&nbsp; And he talked the while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only fault you have, Se&ntilde;or, is being too
generous with your money.&nbsp; In this world you must give
sparingly.&nbsp; The only things you may deal out without
counting, in this life of ours which is but a little fight and a
little love, is blows to your enemy and kisses to a woman. . . .
Ah! here they are coming in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I noticed the dancing light in the dark west much closer to
the shore now.&nbsp; Its motion had altered.&nbsp; It swayed
slowly as it ran towards us, and, suddenly, the darker shadow as
of a great pointed wing appeared gliding in the night.&nbsp;
Under it a human voice shouted something confidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bueno</i>,&rdquo; muttered Dominic.&nbsp; From some
receptacle I didn&rsquo;t see he poured a lot of water on the
blaze, like a magician at the end of a successful incantation
that had called out a shadow and a voice from the immense space
of the sea.&nbsp; And his hooded figure vanished from my sight in
a great hiss and the warm feel of ascending steam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all over,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and now
we go back for more work, more toil, more trouble, more exertion
with hands and feet, for hours and hours.&nbsp; And all the time
the head turned over the shoulder, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were climbing a precipitous path sufficiently dangerous in
the dark, Dominic, more familiar with it, going first and I
scrambling close behind in order that I might grab at his cloak
if I chanced to slip or miss my footing.&nbsp; I remonstrated
against this arrangement as we stopped to rest.&nbsp; I had no
doubt I would grab at his cloak if I felt myself falling.&nbsp; I
couldn&rsquo;t help doing that.&nbsp; But I would probably only
drag him down with me.</p>
<p>With one hand grasping a shadowy bush above his head he
growled that all this was possible, but that it was all in the
bargain, and urged me onwards.</p>
<p>When we got on to the level that man whose even breathing no
exertion, no danger, no fear or anger could disturb, remarked as
we strode side by side:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will say this for us, that we are carrying out all
this deadly foolishness as conscientiously as though the eyes of
the Se&ntilde;ora were on us all the time.&nbsp; And as to risk,
I suppose we take more than she would approve of, I fancy, if she
ever gave a moment&rsquo;s thought to us out here.&nbsp; Now, for
instance, in the next half hour, we may come any moment on three
carabineers who would let off their pieces without asking
questions.&nbsp; Even your way of flinging money about cannot
make safety for men set on defying a whole big country for the
sake of&mdash;what is it exactly?&mdash;the blue eyes, or the
white arms of the Se&ntilde;ora.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He kept his voice equably low.&nbsp; It was a lonely spot and
but for a vague shape of a dwarf tree here and there we had only
the flying clouds for company.&nbsp; Very far off a tiny light
twinkled a little way up the seaward shoulder of an invisible
mountain.&nbsp; Dominic moved on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fancy yourself lying here, on this wild spot, with a
leg smashed by a shot or perhaps with a bullet in your
side.&nbsp; It might happen.&nbsp; A star might fall.&nbsp; I
have watched stars falling in scores on clear nights in the
Atlantic.&nbsp; And it was nothing.&nbsp; The flash of a pinch of
gunpowder in your face may be a bigger matter.&nbsp; Yet somehow
it&rsquo;s pleasant as we stumble in the dark to think of our
Se&ntilde;ora in that long room with a shiny floor and all that
lot of glass at the end, sitting on that divan, you call it,
covered with carpets as if expecting a king indeed.&nbsp; And
very still . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>He remembered her&mdash;whose image could not be
dismissed.</p>
<p>I laid my hand on his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That light on the mountain side flickers exceedingly,
Dominic.&nbsp; Are we in the path?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He addressed me then in French, which was between us the
language of more formal moments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Prenez mon bras</i>, <i>monsieur</i>.&nbsp; Take a
firm hold, or I will have you stumbling again and falling into
one of those beastly holes, with a good chance to crack your
head.&nbsp; And there is no need to take offence.&nbsp; For,
speaking with all respect, why should you, and I with you, be
here on this lonely spot, barking our shins in the dark on the
way to a confounded flickering light where there will be no other
supper but a piece of a stale sausage and a draught of leathery
wine out of a stinking skin.&nbsp; Pah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had good hold of his arm.&nbsp; Suddenly he dropped the
formal French and pronounced in his inflexible voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a pair of white arms, Se&ntilde;or.&nbsp;
<i>Bueno</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could understand.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>
<p>On our return from that expedition we came gliding into the
old harbour so late that Dominic and I, making for the
caf&eacute; kept by Madame L&eacute;onore, found it empty of
customers, except for two rather sinister fellows playing cards
together at a corner table near the door.&nbsp; The first thing
done by Madame L&eacute;onore was to put her hands on
Dominic&rsquo;s shoulders and look at arm&rsquo;s length into the
eyes of that man of audacious deeds and wild stratagems who
smiled straight at her from under his heavy and, at that time,
uncurled moustaches.</p>
<p>Indeed we didn&rsquo;t present a neat appearance, our faces
unshaven, with the traces of dried salt sprays on our smarting
skins and the sleeplessness of full forty hours filming our
eyes.&nbsp; At least it was so with me who saw as through a mist
Madame L&eacute;onore moving with her mature nonchalant grace,
setting before us wine and glasses with a faint swish of her
ample black skirt.&nbsp; Under the elaborate structure of black
hair her jet-black eyes sparkled like good-humoured stars and
even I could see that she was tremendously excited at having this
lawless wanderer Dominic within her reach and as it were in her
power.&nbsp; Presently she sat down by us, touched lightly
Dominic&rsquo;s curly head silvered on the temples (she
couldn&rsquo;t really help it), gazed at me for a while with a
quizzical smile, observed that I looked very tired, and asked
Dominic whether for all that I was likely to sleep soundly
to-night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Dominic,
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s young.&nbsp; And there is always the chance of
dreams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you men dream of in those little barques of
yours tossing for months on the water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mostly of nothing,&rdquo; said Dominic.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But it has happened to me to dream of furious
fights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And of furious loves, too, no doubt,&rdquo; she caught
him up in a mocking voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s for the waking hours,&rdquo; Dominic
drawled, basking sleepily with his head between his hands in her
ardent gaze.&nbsp; &ldquo;The waking hours are longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must be, at sea,&rdquo; she said, never taking her
eyes off him.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I suppose you do talk of your
loves sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may be sure, Madame L&eacute;onore,&rdquo; I
interjected, noticing the hoarseness of my voice, &ldquo;that you
at any rate are talked about a lot at sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not so sure of that now.&nbsp; There is that
strange lady from the Prado that you took him to see,
Signorino.&nbsp; She went to his head like a glass of wine into a
tender youngster&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He is such a child, and I suppose
that I am another.&nbsp; Shame to confess it, the other morning I
got a friend to look after the caf&eacute; for a couple of hours,
wrapped up my head, and walked out there to the other end of the
town. . . . Look at these two sitting up!&nbsp; And I thought
they were so sleepy and tired, the poor fellows!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She kept our curiosity in suspense for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I have seen your marvel, Dominic,&rdquo; she
continued in a calm voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;She came flying out of
the gate on horseback and it would have been all I would have
seen of her if&mdash;and this is for you, Signorino&mdash;if she
hadn&rsquo;t pulled up in the main alley to wait for a very
good-looking cavalier.&nbsp; He had his moustaches so, and his
teeth were very white when he smiled at her.&nbsp; But his eyes
are too deep in his head for my taste.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t like
it.&nbsp; It reminded me of a certain very severe priest who used
to come to our village when I was young; younger even than your
marvel, Dominic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was no priest in disguise, Madame
L&eacute;onore,&rdquo; I said, amused by her expression of
disgust.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s an American.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; <i>Un Americano</i>!&nbsp; Well, never mind
him.&nbsp; It was her that I went to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&nbsp; Walked to the other end of the town to see
Do&ntilde;a Rita!&rdquo;&nbsp; Dominic addressed her in a low
bantering tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, you were always telling me you
couldn&rsquo;t walk further than the end of the quay to save your
life&mdash;or even mine, you said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I did; and I walked back again and between the
two walks I had a good look.&nbsp; And you may be sure&mdash;that
will surprise you both&mdash;that on the way back&mdash;oh, Santa
Madre, wasn&rsquo;t it a long way, too&mdash;I wasn&rsquo;t
thinking of any man at sea or on shore in that
connection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; And you were not thinking of yourself,
either, I suppose,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; Speaking was a matter of
great effort for me, whether I was too tired or too sleepy, I
can&rsquo;t tell.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, you were not thinking of
yourself.&nbsp; You were thinking of a woman, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Si</i>.&nbsp; As much a woman as any of us that ever
breathed in the world.&nbsp; Yes, of her!&nbsp; Of that very
one!&nbsp; You see, we women are not like you men, indifferent to
each other unless by some exception.&nbsp; Men say we are always
against one another but that&rsquo;s only men&rsquo;s
conceit.&nbsp; What can she be to me?&nbsp; I am not afraid of
the big child here,&rdquo; and she tapped Dominic&rsquo;s forearm
on which he rested his head with a fascinated stare.&nbsp;
&ldquo;With us two it is for life and death, and I am rather
pleased that there is something yet in him that can catch fire on
occasion.&nbsp; I would have thought less of him if he
hadn&rsquo;t been able to get out of hand a little, for something
really fine.&nbsp; As for you, Signorino,&rdquo; she turned on me
with an unexpected and sarcastic sally, &ldquo;I am not in love
with you yet.&rdquo;&nbsp; She changed her tone from sarcasm to a
soft and even dreamy note.&nbsp; &ldquo;A head like a gem,&rdquo;
went on that woman born in some by-street of Rome, and a
plaything for years of God knows what obscure fates.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, Dominic!&nbsp; <i>Antica</i>.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t
been haunted by a face since&mdash;since I was sixteen years
old.&nbsp; It was the face of a young cavalier in the
street.&nbsp; He was on horseback, too.&nbsp; He never looked at
me, I never saw him again, and I loved him for&mdash;for days and
days and days.&nbsp; That was the sort of face he had.&nbsp; And
her face is of the same sort.&nbsp; She had a man&rsquo;s hat,
too, on her head.&nbsp; So high!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man&rsquo;s hat on her head,&rdquo; remarked with
profound displeasure Dominic, to whom this wonder, at least, of
all the wonders of the earth, was apparently unknown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Si</i>.&nbsp; And her face has haunted me.&nbsp; Not
so long as that other but more touchingly because I am no longer
sixteen and this is a woman.&nbsp; Yes, I did think of her, I
myself was once that age and I, too, had a face of my own to show
to the world, though not so superb.&nbsp; And I, too,
didn&rsquo;t know why I had come into the world any more than she
does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now you know,&rdquo; Dominic growled softly, with
his head still between his hands.</p>
<p>She looked at him for a long time, opened her lips but in the
end only sighed lightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you know of her, you who have seen her so
well as to be haunted by her face?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t have been surprised if she had answered me
with another sigh.&nbsp; For she seemed only to be thinking of
herself and looked not in my direction.&nbsp; But suddenly she
roused up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of her?&rdquo; she repeated in a louder voice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why should I talk of another woman?&nbsp; And then she is
a great lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this I could not repress a smile which she detected at
once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she?&nbsp; Well, no, perhaps she
isn&rsquo;t; but you may be sure of one thing, that she is both
flesh and shadow more than any one that I have seen.&nbsp; Keep
that well in your mind: She is for no man!&nbsp; She would be
vanishing out of their hands like water that cannot be
held.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I caught my breath.&nbsp; &ldquo;Inconstant,&rdquo; I
whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say that.&nbsp; Maybe too proud, too
wilful, too full of pity.&nbsp; Signorino, you don&rsquo;t know
much about women.&nbsp; And you may learn something yet or you
may not; but what you learn from her you will never
forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to be held,&rdquo; I murmured; and she whom the
quayside called Madame L&eacute;onore closed her outstretched
hand before my face and opened it at once to show its emptiness
in illustration of her expressed opinion.&nbsp; Dominic never
moved.</p>
<p>I wished good-night to these two and left the caf&eacute; for
the fresh air and the dark spaciousness of the quays augmented by
all the width of the old Port where between the trails of light
the shadows of heavy hulls appeared very black, merging their
outlines in a great confusion.&nbsp; I left behind me the end of
the Cannebi&egrave;re, a wide vista of tall houses and
much-lighted pavements losing itself in the distance with an
extinction of both shapes and lights.&nbsp; I slunk past it with
only a side glance and sought the dimness of quiet streets away
from the centre of the usual night gaieties of the town.&nbsp;
The dress I wore was just that of a sailor come ashore from some
coaster, a thick blue woollen shirt or rather a sort of jumper
with a knitted cap like a tam-o&rsquo;-shanter worn very much on
one side and with a red tuft of wool in the centre.&nbsp; This
was even the reason why I had lingered so long in the
caf&eacute;.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t want to be recognized in the
streets in that costume and still less to be seen entering the
house in the street of the Consuls.&nbsp; At that hour when the
performances were over and all the sensible citizens in their
beds I didn&rsquo;t hesitate to cross the Place of the
Opera.&nbsp; It was dark, the audience had already
dispersed.&nbsp; The rare passers-by I met hurrying on their last
affairs of the day paid no attention to me at all.&nbsp; The
street of the Consuls I expected to find empty, as usual at that
time of the night.&nbsp; But as I turned a corner into it I
overtook three people who must have belonged to the
locality.&nbsp; To me, somehow, they appeared strange.&nbsp; Two
girls in dark cloaks walked ahead of a tall man in a top
hat.&nbsp; I slowed down, not wishing to pass them by, the more
so that the door of the house was only a few yards distant.&nbsp;
But to my intense surprise those people stopped at it and the man
in the top hat, producing a latchkey, let his two companions
through, followed them, and with a heavy slam cut himself off
from my astonished self and the rest of mankind.</p>
<p>In the stupid way people have I stood and meditated on the
sight, before it occurred to me that this was the most useless
thing to do.&nbsp; After waiting a little longer to let the
others get away from the hall I entered in my turn.&nbsp; The
small gas-jet seemed not to have been touched ever since that
distant night when Mills and I trod the black-and-white marble
hall for the first time on the heels of Captain Blunt&mdash;who
lived by his sword.&nbsp; And in the dimness and solitude which
kept no more trace of the three strangers than if they had been
the merest ghosts I seemed to hear the ghostly murmur,
&ldquo;<i>Am&eacute;ricain</i>, <i>Catholique et
gentilhomme</i>.&nbsp; <i>Am&eacute;r. . . </i>&rdquo;&nbsp; Unseen by
human eye I ran up the flight of steps swiftly and on the first
floor stepped into my sitting-room of which the door was open . .
. &ldquo;<i>et gentilhomme</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; I tugged at the bell
pull and somewhere down below a bell rang as unexpected for
Therese as a call from a ghost.</p>
<p>I had no notion whether Therese could hear me.&nbsp; I seemed
to remember that she slept in any bed that happened to be
vacant.&nbsp; For all I knew she might have been asleep in
mine.&nbsp; As I had no matches on me I waited for a while in the
dark.&nbsp; The house was perfectly still.&nbsp; Suddenly without
the slightest preliminary sound light fell into the room and
Therese stood in the open door with a candlestick in her
hand.</p>
<p>She had on her peasant brown skirt.&nbsp; The rest of her was
concealed in a black shawl which covered her head, her shoulders,
arms, and elbows completely, down to her waist.&nbsp; The hand
holding the candle protruded from that envelope which the other
invisible hand clasped together under her very chin.&nbsp; And
her face looked like a face in a painting.&nbsp; She said at
once:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You startled me, my young Monsieur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She addressed me most frequently in that way as though she
liked the very word &ldquo;young.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her manner was
certainly peasant-like with a sort of plaint in the voice, while
the face was that of a serving Sister in some small and rustic
convent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I meant to do it,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am a
very bad person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young are always full of fun,&rdquo; she said as if
she were gloating over the idea.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is very
pleasant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are very brave,&rdquo; I chaffed her,
&ldquo;for you didn&rsquo;t expect a ring, and after all it might
have been the devil who pulled the bell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might have been.&nbsp; But a poor girl like me is
not afraid of the devil.&nbsp; I have a pure heart.&nbsp; I have
been to confession last evening.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; But it might
have been an assassin that pulled the bell ready to kill a poor
harmless woman.&nbsp; This is a very lonely street.&nbsp; What
could prevent you to kill me now and then walk out again free as
air?&rdquo;</p>
<p>While she was talking like this she had lighted the gas and
with the last words she glided through the bedroom door leaving
me thunderstruck at the unexpected character of her thoughts.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t know that there had been during my absence a
case of atrocious murder which had affected the imagination of
the whole town; and though Therese did not read the papers (which
she imagined to be full of impieties and immoralities invented by
godless men) yet if she spoke at all with her kind, which she
must have done at least in shops, she could not have helped
hearing of it.&nbsp; It seems that for some days people could
talk of nothing else.&nbsp; She returned gliding from the bedroom
hermetically sealed in her black shawl just as she had gone in,
with the protruding hand holding the lighted candle and relieved
my perplexity as to her morbid turn of mind by telling me
something of the murder story in a strange tone of indifference
even while referring to its most horrible features.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what carnal sin (<i>p&ecirc;ch&eacute; de
chair</i>) leads to,&rdquo; she commented severely and passed her
tongue over her thin lips.&nbsp; &ldquo;And then the devil
furnishes the occasion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine the devil inciting me to murder
you, Therese,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and I didn&rsquo;t like that
ready way you took me for an example, as it were.&nbsp; I suppose
pretty near every lodger might be a potential murderer, but I
expected to be made an exception.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the candle held a little below her face, with that face
of one tone and without relief she looked more than ever as
though she had come out of an old, cracked, smoky painting, the
subject of which was altogether beyond human conception.&nbsp;
And she only compressed her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; I said, making myself comfortable on
a sofa after pulling off my boots.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose any one
is liable to commit murder all of a sudden.&nbsp; Well, have you
got many murderers in the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s pretty
good.&nbsp; Upstairs and downstairs,&rdquo; she sighed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;God sees to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And by the by, who is that grey-headed murderer in a
tall hat whom I saw shepherding two girls into this
house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put on a candid air in which one could detect a little of
her peasant cunning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes.&nbsp; They are two dancing girls at the Opera,
sisters, as different from each other as I and our poor
Rita.&nbsp; But they are both virtuous and that gentleman, their
father, is very severe with them.&nbsp; Very severe indeed, poor
motherless things.&nbsp; And it seems to be such a sinful
occupation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bet you make them pay a big rent, Therese.&nbsp; With
an occupation like that . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at me with eyes of invincible innocence and began
to glide towards the door, so smoothly that the flame of the
candle hardly swayed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; she
murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night, Mademoiselle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then in the very doorway she turned right round as a
marionette would turn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you ought to know, my dear young Monsieur, that Mr.
Blunt, the dear handsome man, has arrived from Navarre three days
ago or more.&nbsp; Oh,&rdquo; she added with a priceless air of
compunction, &ldquo;he is such a charming gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the door shut after her.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>
<p>That night I passed in a state, mostly open-eyed, I believe,
but always on the border between dreams and waking.&nbsp; The
only thing absolutely absent from it was the feeling of
rest.&nbsp; The usual sufferings of a youth in love had nothing
to do with it.&nbsp; I could leave her, go away from her, remain
away from her, without an added pang or any augmented
consciousness of that torturing sentiment of distance so acute
that often it ends by wearing itself out in a few days.&nbsp; Far
or near was all one to me, as if one could never get any further
but also never any nearer to her secret: the state like that of
some strange wild faiths that get hold of mankind with the cruel
mystic grip of unattainable perfection, robbing them of both
liberty and felicity on earth.&nbsp; A faith presents one with
some hope, though.&nbsp; But I had no hope, and not even desire
as a thing outside myself, that would come and go, exhaust or
excite.&nbsp; It was in me just like life was in me; that life of
which a popular saying affirms that &ldquo;it is
sweet.&rdquo;&nbsp; For the general wisdom of mankind will always
stop short on the limit of the formidable.</p>
<p>What is best in a state of brimful, equable suffering is that
it does away with the gnawings of petty sensations.&nbsp; Too far
gone to be sensible to hope and desire I was spared the inferior
pangs of elation and impatience.&nbsp; Hours with her or hours
without her were all alike, all in her possession!&nbsp; But
still there are shades and I will admit that the hours of that
morning were perhaps a little more difficult to get through than
the others.&nbsp; I had sent word of my arrival of course.&nbsp;
I had written a note.&nbsp; I had rung the bell.&nbsp; Therese
had appeared herself in her brown garb and as monachal as
ever.&nbsp; I had said to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have this sent off at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had gazed at the addressed envelope, smiled (I was looking
up at her from my desk), and at last took it up with an effort of
sanctimonious repugnance.&nbsp; But she remained with it in her
hand looking at me as though she were piously gloating over
something she could read in my face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that Rita, that Rita,&rdquo; she murmured.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And you, too!&nbsp; Why are you trying, you, too, like the
others, to stand between her and the mercy of God?&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s the good of all this to you?&nbsp; And you such a
nice, dear, young gentleman.&nbsp; For no earthly good only
making all the kind saints in heaven angry, and our mother
ashamed in her place amongst the blessed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle Therese,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;<i>vous
&ecirc;tes folle</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I believed she was crazy.&nbsp; She was cunning, too.&nbsp; I
added an imperious: &ldquo;<i>Allez</i>,&rdquo; and with a
strange docility she glided out without another word.&nbsp; All I
had to do then was to get dressed and wait till eleven
o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>The hour struck at last.&nbsp; If I could have plunged into a
light wave and been transported instantaneously to Do&ntilde;a
Rita&rsquo;s door it would no doubt have saved me an infinity of
pangs too complex for analysis; but as this was impossible I
elected to walk from end to end of that long way.&nbsp; My
emotions and sensations were childlike and chaotic inasmuch that
they were very intense and primitive, and that I lay very
helpless in their unrelaxing grasp.&nbsp; If one could have kept
a record of one&rsquo;s physical sensations it would have been a
fine collection of absurdities and contradictions.&nbsp; Hardly
touching the ground and yet leaden-footed; with a sinking heart
and an excited brain; hot and trembling with a secret faintness,
and yet as firm as a rock and with a sort of indifference to it
all, I did reach the door which was frightfully like any other
commonplace door, but at the same time had a fateful character: a
few planks put together&mdash;and an awful symbol; not to be
approached without awe&mdash;and yet coming open in the ordinary
way to the ring of the bell.</p>
<p>It came open.&nbsp; Oh, yes, very much as usual.&nbsp; But in
the ordinary course of events the first sight in the hall should
have been the back of the ubiquitous, busy, silent maid hurrying
off and already distant.&nbsp; But not at all!&nbsp; She actually
waited for me to enter.&nbsp; I was extremely taken aback and I
believe spoke to her for the first time in my life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bonjour</i>, Rose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She dropped her dark eyelids over those eyes that ought to
have been lustrous but were not, as if somebody had breathed on
them the first thing in the morning.&nbsp; She was a girl without
smiles.&nbsp; She shut the door after me, and not only did that
but in the incredible idleness of that morning she, who had never
a moment to spare, started helping me off with my overcoat.&nbsp;
It was positively embarrassing from its novelty.&nbsp; While
busying herself with those trifles she murmured without any
marked intention:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Blunt is with Madame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This didn&rsquo;t exactly surprise me.&nbsp; I knew he had
come up to town; I only happened to have forgotten his existence
for the moment.&nbsp; I looked at the girl also without any
particular intention.&nbsp; But she arrested my movement towards
the dining-room door by a low, hurried, if perfectly unemotional
appeal:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur George!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That of course was not my name.&nbsp; It served me then as it
will serve for this story.&nbsp; In all sorts of strange places I
was alluded to as &ldquo;that young gentleman they call Monsieur
George.&rdquo;&nbsp; Orders came from &ldquo;Monsieur
George&rdquo; to men who nodded knowingly.&nbsp; Events pivoted
about &ldquo;Monsieur George.&rdquo;&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t the
slightest doubt that in the dark and tortuous streets of the old
Town there were fingers pointed at my back: there goes
&ldquo;Monsieur George.&rdquo;&nbsp; I had been introduced
discreetly to several considerable persons as &ldquo;Monsieur
George.&rdquo;&nbsp; I had learned to answer to the name quite
naturally; and to simplify matters I was also &ldquo;Monsieur
George&rdquo; in the street of the Consuls and in the Villa on
the Prado.&nbsp; I verily believe that at that time I had the
feeling that the name of George really belonged to me.&nbsp; I
waited for what the girl had to say.&nbsp; I had to wait some
time, though during that silence she gave no sign of distress or
agitation.&nbsp; It was for her obviously a moment of
reflection.&nbsp; Her lips were compressed a little in a
characteristic, capable manner.&nbsp; I looked at her with a
friendliness I really felt towards her slight, unattractive, and
dependable person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said at last, rather amused by this
mental hesitation.&nbsp; I never took it for anything else.&nbsp;
I was sure it was not distrust.&nbsp; She appreciated men and
things and events solely in relation to Do&ntilde;a Rita&rsquo;s
welfare and safety.&nbsp; And as to that I believed myself above
suspicion.&nbsp; At last she spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame is not happy.&rdquo;&nbsp; This information was
given to me not emotionally but as it were officially.&nbsp; It
hadn&rsquo;t even a tone of warning.&nbsp; A mere
statement.&nbsp; Without waiting to see the effect she opened the
dining-room door, not to announce my name in the usual way but to
go in and shut it behind her.&nbsp; In that short moment I heard
no voices inside.&nbsp; Not a sound reached me while the door
remained shut; but in a few seconds it came open again and Rose
stood aside to let me pass.</p>
<p>Then I heard something: Do&ntilde;a Rita&rsquo;s voice raised
a little on an impatient note (a very, very rare thing) finishing
some phrase of protest with the words &ldquo; . . . Of no
consequence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I heard them as I would have heard any other words, for she
had that kind of voice which carries a long distance.&nbsp; But
the maid&rsquo;s statement occupied all my mind.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Madame n&rsquo;est pas heureuse</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
had a dreadful precision . . . &ldquo;Not happy . .
.&rdquo;&nbsp; This unhappiness had almost a concrete
form&mdash;something resembling a horrid bat.&nbsp; I was tired,
excited, and generally overwrought.&nbsp; My head felt
empty.&nbsp; What were the appearances of unhappiness?&nbsp; I
was still na&iuml;ve enough to associate them with tears,
lamentations, extraordinary attitudes of the body and some sort
of facial distortion, all very dreadful to behold.&nbsp; I
didn&rsquo;t know what I should see; but in what I did see there
was nothing startling, at any rate from that nursery point of
view which apparently I had not yet outgrown.</p>
<p>With immense relief the apprehensive child within me beheld
Captain Blunt warming his back at the more distant of the two
fireplaces; and as to Do&ntilde;a Rita there was nothing
extraordinary in her attitude either, except perhaps that her
hair was all loose about her shoulders.&nbsp; I hadn&rsquo;t the
slightest doubt they had been riding together that morning, but
she, with her impatience of all costume (and yet she could dress
herself admirably and wore her dresses triumphantly), had
divested herself of her riding habit and sat cross-legged
enfolded in that ample blue robe like a young savage chieftain in
a blanket.&nbsp; It covered her very feet.&nbsp; And before the
normal fixity of her enigmatical eyes the smoke of the cigarette
ascended ceremonially, straight up, in a slender spiral.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you,&rdquo; was the greeting of Captain Blunt
with the usual smile which would have been more amiable if his
teeth hadn&rsquo;t been, just then, clenched quite so
tight.&nbsp; How he managed to force his voice through that
shining barrier I could never understand.&nbsp; Do&ntilde;a Rita
tapped the couch engagingly by her side but I sat down instead in
the armchair nearly opposite her, which, I imagine, must have
been just vacated by Blunt.&nbsp; She inquired with that
particular gleam of the eyes in which there was something
immemorial and gay:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfect success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could hug you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At any time her lips moved very little but in this instance
the intense whisper of these words seemed to form itself right in
my very heart; not as a conveyed sound but as an imparted emotion
vibrating there with an awful intimacy of delight.&nbsp; And yet
it left my heart heavy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, for joy,&rdquo; I said bitterly but very low;
&ldquo;for your Royalist, Legitimist, joy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then with
that trick of very precise politeness which I must have caught
from Mr. Blunt I added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be embraced&mdash;for the
King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I might have stopped there.&nbsp; But I
didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; With a perversity which should be forgiven to
those who suffer night and day and are as if drunk with an
exalted unhappiness, I went on: &ldquo;For the sake of an old
cast-off glove; for I suppose a disdained love is not much more
than a soiled, flabby thing that finds itself on a private
rubbish heap because it has missed the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She listened to me unreadable, unmoved, narrowed eyes, closed
lips, slightly flushed face, as if carved six thousand years ago
in order to fix for ever that something secret and obscure which
is in all women.&nbsp; Not the gross immobility of a Sphinx
proposing roadside riddles but the finer immobility, almost
sacred, of a fateful figure seated at the very source of the
passions that have moved men from the dawn of ages.</p>
<p>Captain Blunt, with his elbow on the high mantelpiece, had
turned away a little from us and his attitude expressed
excellently the detachment of a man who does not want to
hear.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, I don&rsquo;t suppose he could
have heard.&nbsp; He was too far away, our voices were too
contained.&nbsp; Moreover, he didn&rsquo;t want to hear.&nbsp;
There could be no doubt about it; but she addressed him
unexpectedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I was saying to you, Don Juan, I have the greatest
difficulty in getting myself, I won&rsquo;t say understood, but
simply believed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No pose of detachment could avail against the warm waves of
that voice.&nbsp; He had to hear.&nbsp; After a moment he altered
his position as it were reluctantly, to answer her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a difficulty that women generally
have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet I have always spoken the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All women speak the truth,&rdquo; said Blunt
imperturbably.&nbsp; And this annoyed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are the men I have deceived?&rdquo; she
cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, where?&rdquo; said Blunt in a tone of alacrity as
though he had been ready to go out and look for them outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&nbsp; But show me one.&nbsp; I say&mdash;where is
he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He threw his affectation of detachment to the winds, moved his
shoulders slightly, very slightly, made a step nearer to the
couch, and looked down on her with an expression of amused
courtesy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; Probably nowhere.&nbsp;
But if such a man could be found I am certain he would turn out a
very stupid person.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t be expected to furnish
every one who approaches you with a mind.&nbsp; To expect that
would be too much, even from you who know how to work wonders at
such little cost to yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To myself,&rdquo; she repeated in a loud tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why this indignation?&nbsp; I am simply taking your
word for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such little cost!&rdquo; she exclaimed under her
breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean to your person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she murmured, glanced down, as it were
upon herself, then added very low: &ldquo;This body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it is you,&rdquo; said Blunt with visibly
contained irritation.&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t pretend
it&rsquo;s somebody else&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It can&rsquo;t be.&nbsp;
You haven&rsquo;t borrowed it. . . . It fits you too well,&rdquo;
he ended between his teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You take pleasure in tormenting yourself,&rdquo; she
remonstrated, suddenly placated; &ldquo;and I would be sorry for
you if I didn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the mere revolt of your
pride.&nbsp; And you know you are indulging your pride at my
expense.&nbsp; As to the rest of it, as to my living, acting,
working wonders at a little cost. . . . it has all but killed me
morally.&nbsp; Do you hear?&nbsp; Killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are not dead yet,&rdquo; he muttered,</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said with gentle patience.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There is still some feeling left in me; and if it is any
satisfaction to you to know it, you may be certain that I shall
be conscious of the last stab.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He remained silent for a while and then with a polite smile
and a movement of the head in my direction he warned her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our audience will get bored.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am perfectly aware that Monsieur George is here, and
that he has been breathing a very different atmosphere from what
he gets in this room.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you find this room
extremely confined?&rdquo; she asked me.</p>
<p>The room was very large but it is a fact that I felt oppressed
at that moment.&nbsp; This mysterious quarrel between those two
people, revealing something more close in their intercourse than
I had ever before suspected, made me so profoundly unhappy that I
didn&rsquo;t even attempt to answer.&nbsp; And she continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;More space.&nbsp; More air.&nbsp; Give me air,
air.&rdquo;&nbsp; She seized the embroidered edges of her blue
robe under her white throat and made as if to tear them apart, to
fling it open on her breast, recklessly, before our eyes.&nbsp;
We both remained perfectly still.&nbsp; Her hands dropped
nervelessly by her side.&nbsp; &ldquo;I envy you, Monsieur
George.&nbsp; If I am to go under I should prefer to be drowned
in the sea with the wind on my face.&nbsp; What luck, to feel
nothing less than all the world closing over one&rsquo;s
head!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A short silence ensued before Mr. Blunt&rsquo;s drawing-room
voice was heard with playful familiarity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have often asked myself whether you weren&rsquo;t
really a very ambitious person, Do&ntilde;a Rita.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I ask myself whether you have any
heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; She was looking straight at him and he
gratified her with the usual cold white flash of his even teeth
before he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Asking yourself?&nbsp; That means that you are really
asking me.&nbsp; But why do it so publicly?&nbsp; I mean
it.&nbsp; One single, detached presence is enough to make a
public.&nbsp; One alone.&nbsp; Why not wait till he returns to
those regions of space and air&mdash;from which he
came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His particular trick of speaking of any third person as of a
lay figure was exasperating.&nbsp; Yet at the moment I did not
know how to resent it, but, in any case, Do&ntilde;a Rita would
not have given me time.&nbsp; Without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation
she cried out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only wish he could take me out there with
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Mr. Blunt&rsquo;s face became as still as a mask
and then instead of an angry it assumed an indulgent
expression.&nbsp; As to me I had a rapid vision of
Dominic&rsquo;s astonishment, awe, and sarcasm which was always
as tolerant as it is possible for sarcasm to be.&nbsp; But what a
charming, gentle, gay, and fearless companion she would have
made!&nbsp; I believed in her fearlessness in any adventure that
would interest her.&nbsp; It would be a new occasion for me, a
new viewpoint for that faculty of admiration she had awakened in
me at sight&mdash;at first sight&mdash;before she opened her
lips&mdash;before she ever turned her eyes on me.&nbsp; She would
have to wear some sort of sailor costume, a blue woollen shirt
open at the throat. . . . Dominic&rsquo;s hooded cloak would
envelop her amply, and her face under the black hood would have a
luminous quality, adolescent charm, and an enigmatic
expression.&nbsp; The confined space of the little vessel&rsquo;s
quarterdeck would lend itself to her cross-legged attitudes, and
the blue sea would balance gently her characteristic immobility
that seemed to hide thoughts as old and profound as itself.&nbsp;
As restless, too&mdash;perhaps.</p>
<p>But the picture I had in my eye, coloured and simple like an
illustration to a nursery-book tale of two venturesome
children&rsquo;s escapade, was what fascinated me most.&nbsp;
Indeed I felt that we two were like children under the gaze of a
man of the world&mdash;who lived by his sword.&nbsp; And I said
recklessly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you ought to come along with us for a trip.&nbsp;
You would see a lot of things for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Blunt&rsquo;s expression had grown even more indulgent if
that were possible.&nbsp; Yet there was something ineradicably
ambiguous about that man.&nbsp; I did not like the indefinable
tone in which he observed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are perfectly reckless in what you say, Do&ntilde;a
Rita.&nbsp; It has become a habit with you of late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While with you reserve is a second nature, Don
Juan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was uttered with the gentlest, almost tender,
irony.&nbsp; Mr. Blunt waited a while before he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. . . . Would you have liked me to be
otherwise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She extended her hand to him on a sudden impulse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me!&nbsp; I may have been unjust, and you may
only have been loyal.&nbsp; The falseness is not in us.&nbsp; The
fault is in life itself, I suppose.&nbsp; I have been always
frank with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I obedient,&rdquo; he said, bowing low over her
hand.&nbsp; He turned away, paused to look at me for some time
and finally gave me the correct sort of nod.&nbsp; But he said
nothing and went out, or rather lounged out with his worldly
manner of perfect ease under all conceivable circumstances.&nbsp;
With her head lowered Do&ntilde;a Rita watched him till he
actually shut the door behind him.&nbsp; I was facing her and
only heard the door close.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stare at me,&rdquo; were the first words
she said.</p>
<p>It was difficult to obey that request.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t
know exactly where to look, while I sat facing her.&nbsp; So I
got up, vaguely full of goodwill, prepared even to move off as
far as the window, when she commanded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t turn your back on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I chose to understand it symbolically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know very well I could never do that.&nbsp; I
couldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Not even if I wanted to.&rdquo;&nbsp; And I
added: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, sit down.&nbsp; Sit down on this
couch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I sat down on the couch.&nbsp; Unwillingly?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; I
was at that stage when all her words, all her gestures, all her
silences were a heavy trial to me, put a stress on my resolution,
on that fidelity to myself and to her which lay like a leaden
weight on my untried heart.&nbsp; But I didn&rsquo;t sit down
very far away from her, though that soft and billowy couch was
big enough, God knows!&nbsp; No, not very far from her.&nbsp;
Self-control, dignity, hopelessness itself, have their
limits.&nbsp; The halo of her tawny hair stirred as I let myself
drop by her side.&nbsp; Whereupon she flung one arm round my
neck, leaned her temple against my shoulder and began to sob; but
that I could only guess from her slight, convulsive movements
because in our relative positions I could only see the mass of
her tawny hair brushed back, yet with a halo of escaped hair
which as I bent my head over her tickled my lips, my cheek, in a
maddening manner.</p>
<p>We sat like two venturesome children in an illustration to a
tale, scared by their adventure.&nbsp; But not for long.&nbsp; As
I instinctively, yet timidly, sought for her other hand I felt a
tear strike the back of mine, big and heavy as if fallen from a
great height.&nbsp; It was too much for me.&nbsp; I must have
given a nervous start.&nbsp; At once I heard a murmur: &ldquo;You
had better go away now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I withdrew myself gently from under the light weight of her
head, from this unspeakable bliss and inconceivable misery, and
had the absurd impression of leaving her suspended in the
air.&nbsp; And I moved away on tiptoe.</p>
<p>Like an inspired blind man led by Providence I found my way
out of the room but really I saw nothing, till in the hall the
maid appeared by enchantment before me holding up my
overcoat.&nbsp; I let her help me into it.&nbsp; And then (again
as if by enchantment) she had my hat in her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; Madame isn&rsquo;t happy,&rdquo; I whispered
to her distractedly.</p>
<p>She let me take my hat out of her hand and while I was putting
it on my head I heard an austere whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame should listen to her heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Austere is not the word; it was almost freezing, this
unexpected, dispassionate rustle of words.&nbsp; I had to repress
a shudder, and as coldly as herself I murmured:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has done that once too often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose was standing very close to me and I caught distinctly the
note of scorn in her indulgent compassion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that! . . . Madame is like a child.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
was impossible to get the bearing of that utterance from that
girl who, as Do&ntilde;a Rita herself had told me, was the most
taciturn of human beings; and yet of all human beings the one
nearest to herself.&nbsp; I seized her head in my hands and
turning up her face I looked straight down into her black eyes
which should have been lustrous.&nbsp; Like a piece of glass
breathed upon they reflected no light, revealed no depths, and
under my ardent gaze remained tarnished, misty, unconscious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will Monsieur kindly let me go.&nbsp; Monsieur
shouldn&rsquo;t play the child, either.&rdquo;&nbsp; (I let her
go.)&nbsp; &ldquo;Madame could have the world at her feet.&nbsp;
Indeed she has it there only she doesn&rsquo;t care for
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How talkative she was, this maid with unsealed lips!&nbsp; For
some reason or other this last statement of hers brought me
immense comfort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; I whispered breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&nbsp; But in that case what&rsquo;s the use of
living in fear and torment?&rdquo; she went on, revealing a
little more of herself to my astonishment.&nbsp; She opened the
door for me and added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those that don&rsquo;t care to stoop ought at least
make themselves happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I turned in the very doorway: &ldquo;There is something which
prevents that?&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure there is.&nbsp; <i>Bonjour</i>,
Monsieur.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>PART FOUR</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Such a charming lady in a grey silk dress and a hand as
white as snow.&nbsp; She looked at me through such funny glasses
on the end of a long handle.&nbsp; A very great lady but her
voice was as kind as the voice of a saint.&nbsp; I have never
seen anything like that.&nbsp; She made me feel so
timid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice uttering these words was the voice of Therese and I
looked at her from a bed draped heavily in brown silk curtains
fantastically looped up from ceiling to floor.&nbsp; The glow of
a sunshiny day was toned down by closed jalousies to a mere
transparency of darkness.&nbsp; In this thin medium
Therese&rsquo;s form appeared flat, without detail, as if cut out
of black paper.&nbsp; It glided towards the window and with a
click and a scrape let in the full flood of light which smote my
aching eyeballs painfully.</p>
<p>In truth all that night had been the abomination of desolation
to me.&nbsp; After wrestling with my thoughts, if the acute
consciousness of a woman&rsquo;s existence may be called a
thought, I had apparently dropped off to sleep only to go on
wrestling with a nightmare, a senseless and terrifying dream of
being in bonds which, even after waking, made me feel powerless
in all my limbs.&nbsp; I lay still, suffering acutely from a
renewed sense of existence, unable to lift an arm, and wondering
why I was not at sea, how long I had slept, how long Therese had
been talking before her voice had reached me in that purgatory of
hopeless longing and unanswerable questions to which I was
condemned.</p>
<p>It was Therese&rsquo;s habit to begin talking directly she
entered the room with the tray of morning coffee.&nbsp; This was
her method for waking me up.&nbsp; I generally regained the
consciousness of the external world on some pious phrase
asserting the spiritual comfort of early mass, or on angry
lamentations about the unconscionable rapacity of the dealers in
fish and vegetables; for after mass it was Therese&rsquo;s
practice to do the marketing for the house.&nbsp; As a matter of
fact the necessity of having to pay, to actually give money to
people, infuriated the pious Therese.&nbsp; But the matter of
this morning&rsquo;s speech was so extraordinary that it might
have been the prolongation of a nightmare: a man in bonds having
to listen to weird and unaccountable speeches against which, he
doesn&rsquo;t know why, his very soul revolts.</p>
<p>In sober truth my soul remained in revolt though I was
convinced that I was no longer dreaming.&nbsp; I watched Therese
coming away from the window with that helpless dread a man bound
hand and foot may be excused to feel.&nbsp; For in such a
situation even the absurd may appear ominous.&nbsp; She came up
close to the bed and folding her hands meekly in front of her
turned her eyes up to the ceiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had been her daughter she couldn&rsquo;t have
spoken more softly to me,&rdquo; she said sentimentally.</p>
<p>I made a great effort to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle Therese, you are raving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She addressed me as Mademoiselle, too, so nicely.&nbsp;
I was struck with veneration for her white hair but her face,
believe me, my dear young Monsieur, has not so many wrinkles as
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She compressed her lips with an angry glance at me as if I
could help her wrinkles, then she sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God sends wrinkles, but what is our face?&rdquo; she
digressed in a tone of great humility.&nbsp; &ldquo;We shall have
glorious faces in Paradise.&nbsp; But meantime God has permitted
me to preserve a smooth heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to keep on like this much longer?&rdquo;
I fairly shouted at her.&nbsp; &ldquo;What are you talking
about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am talking about the sweet old lady who came in a
carriage.&nbsp; Not a fiacre.&nbsp; I can tell a fiacre.&nbsp; In
a little carriage shut in with glass all in front.&nbsp; I
suppose she is very rich.&nbsp; The carriage was very shiny
outside and all beautiful grey stuff inside.&nbsp; I opened the
door to her myself.&nbsp; She got out slowly like a queen.&nbsp;
I was struck all of a heap.&nbsp; Such a shiny beautiful little
carriage.&nbsp; There were blue silk tassels inside, beautiful
silk tassels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obviously Therese had been very much impressed by a brougham,
though she didn&rsquo;t know the name for it.&nbsp; Of all the
town she knew nothing but the streets which led to a neighbouring
church frequented only by the poorer classes and the humble
quarter around, where she did her marketing.&nbsp; Besides, she
was accustomed to glide along the walls with her eyes cast down;
for her natural boldness would never show itself through that
nun-like mien except when bargaining, if only on a matter of
threepence.&nbsp; Such a turn-out had never been presented to her
notice before.&nbsp; The traffic in the street of the Consuls was
mostly pedestrian and far from fashionable.&nbsp; And anyhow
Therese never looked out of the window.&nbsp; She lurked in the
depths of the house like some kind of spider that shuns
attention.&nbsp; She used to dart at one from some dark recesses
which I never explored.</p>
<p>Yet it seemed to me that she exaggerated her raptures for some
reason or other.&nbsp; With her it was very difficult to
distinguish between craft and innocence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say,&rdquo; I asked suspiciously,
&ldquo;that an old lady wants to hire an apartment here?&nbsp; I
hope you told her there was no room, because, you know, this
house is not exactly the thing for venerable old
ladies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make me angry, my dear young
Monsieur.&nbsp; I have been to confession this morning.&nbsp;
Aren&rsquo;t you comfortable?&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t the house
appointed richly enough for anybody?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That girl with a peasant-nun&rsquo;s face had never seen the
inside of a house other than some half-ruined <i>caserio</i> in
her native hills.</p>
<p>I pointed out to her that this was not a matter of splendour
or comfort but of &ldquo;convenances.&rdquo;&nbsp; She pricked up
her ears at that word which probably she had never heard before;
but with woman&rsquo;s uncanny intuition I believe she understood
perfectly what I meant.&nbsp; Her air of saintly patience became
so pronounced that with my own poor intuition I perceived that
she was raging at me inwardly.&nbsp; Her weather-tanned
complexion, already affected by her confined life, took on an
extraordinary clayey aspect which reminded me of a strange head
painted by El Greco which my friend Prax had hung on one of his
walls and used to rail at; yet not without a certain respect.</p>
<p>Therese, with her hands still meekly folded about her waist,
had mastered the feelings of anger so unbecoming to a person
whose sins had been absolved only about three hours before, and
asked me with an insinuating softness whether she wasn&rsquo;t an
honest girl enough to look after any old lady belonging to a
world which after all was sinful.&nbsp; She reminded me that she
had kept house ever since she was &ldquo;so high&rdquo; for her
uncle the priest: a man well-known for his saintliness in a large
district extending even beyond Pampeluna.&nbsp; The character of
a house depended upon the person who ruled it.&nbsp; She
didn&rsquo;t know what impenitent wretches had been breathing
within these walls in the time of that godless and wicked man who
had planted every seed of perdition in &ldquo;our
Rita&rsquo;s&rdquo; ill-disposed heart.&nbsp; But he was dead and
she, Therese, knew for certain that wickedness perished utterly,
because of God&rsquo;s anger (<i>la col&egrave;re du bon
Dieu</i>).&nbsp; She would have no hesitation in receiving a
bishop, if need be, since &ldquo;our, Rita,&rdquo; with her poor,
wretched, unbelieving heart, had nothing more to do with the
house.</p>
<p>All this came out of her like an unctuous trickle of some
acrid oil.&nbsp; The low, voluble delivery was enough by itself
to compel my attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think you know your sister&rsquo;s heart,&rdquo; I
asked.</p>
<p>She made small eyes at me to discover if I was angry.&nbsp;
She seemed to have an invincible faith in the virtuous
dispositions of young men.&nbsp; And as I had spoken in measured
tones and hadn&rsquo;t got red in the face she let herself
go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Black, my dear young Monsieur.&nbsp; Black.&nbsp; I
always knew it.&nbsp; Uncle, poor saintly man, was too holy to
take notice of anything.&nbsp; He was too busy with his thoughts
to listen to anything I had to say to him.&nbsp; For instance as
to her shamelessness.&nbsp; She was always ready to run half
naked about the hills. . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; After your goats.&nbsp; All day long.&nbsp;
Why didn&rsquo;t you mend her frocks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you know about the goats.&nbsp; My dear young
Monsieur, I could never tell when she would fling over her
pretended sweetness and put her tongue out at me.&nbsp; Did she
tell you about a boy, the son of pious and rich parents, whom she
tried to lead astray into the wildness of thoughts like her own,
till the poor dear child drove her off because she outraged his
modesty?&nbsp; I saw him often with his parents at Sunday
mass.&nbsp; The grace of God preserved him and made him quite a
gentleman in Paris.&nbsp; Perhaps it will touch Rita&rsquo;s
heart, too, some day.&nbsp; But she was awful then.&nbsp; When I
wouldn&rsquo;t listen to her complaints she would say: &lsquo;All
right, sister, I would just as soon go clothed in rain and
wind.&rsquo;&nbsp; And such a bag of bones, too, like the picture
of a devil&rsquo;s imp.&nbsp; Ah, my dear young Monsieur, you
don&rsquo;t know how wicked her heart is.&nbsp; You aren&rsquo;t
bad enough for that yourself.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe you are
evil at all in your innocent little heart.&nbsp; I never heard
you jeer at holy things.&nbsp; You are only thoughtless.&nbsp;
For instance, I have never seen you make the sign of the cross in
the morning.&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t you make a practice of
crossing yourself directly you open your eyes.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a
very good thing.&nbsp; It keeps Satan off for the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She proffered that advice in a most matter-of-fact tone as if
it were a precaution against a cold, compressed her lips, then
returning to her fixed idea, &ldquo;But the house is mine,&rdquo;
she insisted very quietly with an accent which made me feel that
Satan himself would never manage to tear it out of her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so I told the great lady in grey.&nbsp; I told her
that my sister had given it to me and that surely God would not
let her take it away again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You told that grey-headed lady, an utter
stranger!&nbsp; You are getting more crazy every day.&nbsp; You
have neither good sense nor good feeling, Mademoiselle Therese,
let me tell you.&nbsp; Do you talk about your sister to the
butcher and the greengrocer, too?&nbsp; A downright savage would
have more restraint.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s your object?&nbsp; What
do you expect from it?&nbsp; What pleasure do you get from
it?&nbsp; Do you think you please God by abusing your
sister?&nbsp; What do you think you are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A poor lone girl amongst a lot of wicked people.&nbsp;
Do you think I wanted to go forth amongst those abominations?
it&rsquo;s that poor sinful Rita that wouldn&rsquo;t let me be
where I was, serving a holy man, next door to a church, and sure
of my share of Paradise.&nbsp; I simply obeyed my uncle.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s he who told me to go forth and attempt to save her
soul, bring her back to us, to a virtuous life.&nbsp; But what
would be the good of that?&nbsp; She is given over to worldly,
carnal thoughts.&nbsp; Of course we are a good family and my
uncle is a great man in the country, but where is the reputable
farmer or God-fearing man of that kind that would dare to bring
such a girl into his house to his mother and sisters.&nbsp; No,
let her give her ill-gotten wealth up to the deserving and devote
the rest of her life to repentance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She uttered these righteous reflections and presented this
programme for the salvation of her sister&rsquo;s soul in a
reasonable convinced tone which was enough to give goose flesh to
one all over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle Therese,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you are
nothing less than a monster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She received that true expression of my opinion as though I
had given her a sweet of a particularly delicious kind.&nbsp; She
liked to be abused.&nbsp; It pleased her to be called
names.&nbsp; I did let her have that satisfaction to her
heart&rsquo;s content.&nbsp; At last I stopped because I could do
no more, unless I got out of bed to beat her.&nbsp; I have a
vague notion that she would have liked that, too, but I
didn&rsquo;t try.&nbsp; After I had stopped she waited a little
before she raised her downcast eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a dear, ignorant, flighty young
gentleman,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nobody can tell what a
cross my sister is to me except the good priest in the church
where I go every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the mysterious lady in grey,&rdquo; I suggested
sarcastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a person might have guessed it,&rdquo; answered
Therese, seriously, &ldquo;but I told her nothing except that
this house had been given me in full property by our Rita.&nbsp;
And I wouldn&rsquo;t have done that if she hadn&rsquo;t spoken to
me of my sister first.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t tell too many people
about that.&nbsp; One can&rsquo;t trust Rita.&nbsp; I know she
doesn&rsquo;t fear God but perhaps human respect may keep her
from taking this house back from me.&nbsp; If she doesn&rsquo;t
want me to talk about her to people why doesn&rsquo;t she give me
a properly stamped piece of paper for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said all this rapidly in one breath and at the end had a
sort of anxious gasp which gave me the opportunity to voice my
surprise.&nbsp; It was immense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That lady, the strange lady, spoke to you of your
sister first!&rdquo; I cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lady asked me, after she had been in a little time,
whether really this house belonged to Madame de Lastaola.&nbsp;
She had been so sweet and kind and condescending that I did not
mind humiliating my spirit before such a good Christian.&nbsp; I
told her that I didn&rsquo;t know how the poor sinner in her mad
blindness called herself, but that this house had been given to
me truly enough by my sister.&nbsp; She raised her eyebrows at
that but she looked at me at the same time so kindly, as much as
to say, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t trust much to that, my dear
girl,&rsquo; that I couldn&rsquo;t help taking up her hand, soft
as down, and kissing it.&nbsp; She took it away pretty quick but
she was not offended.&nbsp; But she only said,
&lsquo;That&rsquo;s very generous on your sister&rsquo;s
part,&rsquo; in a way that made me run cold all over.&nbsp; I
suppose all the world knows our Rita for a shameless girl.&nbsp;
It was then that the lady took up those glasses on a long gold
handle and looked at me through them till I felt very much
abashed.&nbsp; She said to me, &lsquo;There is nothing to be
unhappy about.&nbsp; Madame de Lastaola is a very remarkable
person who has done many surprising things.&nbsp; She is not to
be judged like other people and as far as I know she has never
wronged a single human being. . . .&rsquo;&nbsp; That put heart
into me, I can tell you; and the lady told me then not to disturb
her son.&nbsp; She would wait till he woke up.&nbsp; She knew he
was a bad sleeper.&nbsp; I said to her: &lsquo;Why, I can hear
the dear sweet gentleman this moment having his bath in the
fencing-room,&rsquo; and I took her into the studio.&nbsp; They
are there now and they are going to have their lunch together at
twelve o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why on earth didn&rsquo;t you tell me at first that the
lady was Mrs. Blunt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I?&nbsp; I thought I did,&rdquo; she said
innocently.&nbsp; I felt a sudden desire to get out of that
house, to fly from the reinforced Blunt element which was to me
so oppressive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to get up and dress, Mademoiselle
Therese,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>She gave a slight start and without looking at me again glided
out of the room, the many folds of her brown skirt remaining
undisturbed as she moved.</p>
<p>I looked at my watch; it was ten o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Therese
had been late with my coffee.&nbsp; The delay was clearly caused
by the unexpected arrival of Mr. Blunt&rsquo;s mother, which
might or might not have been expected by her son.&nbsp; The
existence of those Blunts made me feel uncomfortable in a
peculiar way as though they had been the denizens of another
planet with a subtly different point of view and something in the
intelligence which was bound to remain unknown to me.&nbsp; It
caused in me a feeling of inferiority which I intensely
disliked.&nbsp; This did not arise from the actual fact that
those people originated in another continent.&nbsp; I had met
Americans before.&nbsp; And the Blunts were Americans.&nbsp; But
so little!&nbsp; That was the trouble.&nbsp; Captain Blunt might
have been a Frenchman as far as languages, tones, and manners
went.&nbsp; But you could not have mistaken him for one. . . .
Why?&nbsp; You couldn&rsquo;t tell.&nbsp; It was something
indefinite.&nbsp; It occurred to me while I was towelling hard my
hair, face, and the back of my neck, that I could not meet J. K.
Blunt on equal terms in any relation of life except perhaps arms
in hand, and in preference with pistols, which are less intimate,
acting at a distance&mdash;but arms of some sort.&nbsp; For
physically his life, which could be taken away from him, was
exactly like mine, held on the same terms and of the same
vanishing quality.</p>
<p>I would have smiled at my absurdity if all, even the most
intimate, vestige of gaiety had not been crushed out of my heart
by the intolerable weight of my love for Rita.&nbsp; It crushed,
it overshadowed, too, it was immense.&nbsp; If there were any
smiles in the world (which I didn&rsquo;t believe) I could not
have seen them.&nbsp; Love for Rita . . . if it was love, I asked
myself despairingly, while I brushed my hair before a
glass.&nbsp; It did not seem to have any sort of beginning as far
as I could remember.&nbsp; A thing the origin of which you cannot
trace cannot be seriously considered.&nbsp; It is an
illusion.&nbsp; Or perhaps mine was a physical state, some sort
of disease akin to melancholia which is a form of insanity?&nbsp;
The only moments of relief I could remember were when she and I
would start squabbling like two passionate infants in a nursery,
over anything under heaven, over a phrase, a word sometimes, in
the great light of the glass rotunda, disregarding the quiet
entrances and exits of the ever-active Rose, in great bursts of
voices and peals of laughter. . . .</p>
<p>I felt tears come into my eyes at the memory of her laughter,
the true memory of the senses almost more penetrating than the
reality itself.&nbsp; It haunted me.&nbsp; All that appertained
to her haunted me with the same awful intimacy, her whole form in
the familiar pose, her very substance in its colour and texture,
her eyes, her lips, the gleam of her teeth, the tawny mist of her
hair, the smoothness of her forehead, the faint scent that she
used, the very shape, feel, and warmth of her high-heeled slipper
that would sometimes in the heat of the discussion drop on the
floor with a crash, and which I would (always in the heat of the
discussion) pick up and toss back on the couch without ceasing to
argue.&nbsp; And besides being haunted by what was Rita on earth
I was haunted also by her waywardness, her gentleness and her
flame, by that which the high gods called Rita when speaking of
her amongst themselves.&nbsp; Oh, yes, certainly I was haunted by
her but so was her sister Therese&mdash;who was crazy.&nbsp; It
proved nothing.&nbsp; As to her tears, since I had not caused
them, they only aroused my indignation.&nbsp; To put her head on
my shoulder, to weep these strange tears, was nothing short of an
outrageous liberty.&nbsp; It was a mere emotional trick.&nbsp;
She would have just as soon leaned her head against the
over-mantel of one of those tall, red granite chimney-pieces in
order to weep comfortably.&nbsp; And then when she had no longer
any need of support she dispensed with it by simply telling me to
go away.&nbsp; How convenient!&nbsp; The request had sounded
pathetic, almost sacredly so, but then it might have been the
exhibition of the coolest possible impudence.&nbsp; With her one
could not tell.&nbsp; Sorrow, indifference, tears, smiles, all
with her seemed to have a hidden meaning.&nbsp; Nothing could be
trusted. . . Heavens!&nbsp; Am I as crazy as Therese I asked
myself with a passing chill of fear, while occupied in equalizing
the ends of my neck-tie.</p>
<p>I felt suddenly that &ldquo;this sort of thing&rdquo; would
kill me.&nbsp; The definition of the cause was vague, but the
thought itself was no mere morbid artificiality of sentiment but
a genuine conviction.&nbsp; &ldquo;That sort of thing&rdquo; was
what I would have to die from.&nbsp; It wouldn&rsquo;t be from
the innumerable doubts.&nbsp; Any sort of certitude would be also
deadly.&nbsp; It wouldn&rsquo;t be from a stab&mdash;a kiss would
kill me as surely.&nbsp; It would not be from a frown or from any
particular word or any particular act&mdash;but from having to
bear them all, together and in succession&mdash;from having to
live with &ldquo;that sort of thing.&rdquo;&nbsp; About the time
I finished with my neck-tie I had done with life too.&nbsp; I
absolutely did not care because I couldn&rsquo;t tell whether,
mentally and physically, from the roots of my hair to the soles
of my feet&mdash;whether I was more weary or unhappy.</p>
<p>And now my toilet was finished, my occupation was gone.&nbsp;
An immense distress descended upon me.&nbsp; It has been observed
that the routine of daily life, that arbitrary system of trifles,
is a great moral support.&nbsp; But my toilet was finished, I had
nothing more to do of those things consecrated by usage and which
leave you no option.&nbsp; The exercise of any kind of volition
by a man whose consciousness is reduced to the sensation that he
is being killed by &ldquo;that sort of thing&rdquo; cannot be
anything but mere trifling with death, an insincere pose before
himself.&nbsp; I wasn&rsquo;t capable of it.&nbsp; It was then
that I discovered that being killed by &ldquo;that sort of
thing,&rdquo; I mean the absolute conviction of it, was, so to
speak, nothing in itself.&nbsp; The horrible part was the
waiting.&nbsp; That was the cruelty, the tragedy, the bitterness
of it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why the devil don&rsquo;t I drop dead
now?&rdquo; I asked myself peevishly, taking a clean handkerchief
out of the drawer and stuffing it in my pocket.</p>
<p>This was absolutely the last thing, the last ceremony of an
imperative rite.&nbsp; I was abandoned to myself now and it was
terrible.&nbsp; Generally I used to go out, walk down to the
port, take a look at the craft I loved with a sentiment that was
extremely complex, being mixed up with the image of a woman;
perhaps go on board, not because there was anything for me to do
there but just for nothing, for happiness, simply as a man will
sit contented in the companionship of the beloved object.&nbsp;
For lunch I had the choice of two places, one Bohemian, the other
select, even aristocratic, where I had still my reserved table in
the <i>petit salon</i>, up the white staircase.&nbsp; In both
places I had friends who treated my erratic appearances with
discretion, in one case tinged with respect, in the other with a
certain amused tolerance.&nbsp; I owed this tolerance to the most
careless, the most confirmed of those Bohemians (his beard had
streaks of grey amongst its many other tints) who, once bringing
his heavy hand down on my shoulder, took my defence against the
charge of being disloyal and even foreign to that milieu of
earnest visions taking beautiful and revolutionary shapes in the
smoke of pipes, in the jingle of glasses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That fellow (<i>ce gar&ccedil;on</i>) is a primitive
nature, but he may be an artist in a sense.&nbsp; He has broken
away from his conventions.&nbsp; He is trying to put a special
vibration and his own notion of colour into his life; and perhaps
even to give it a modelling according to his own ideas.&nbsp; And
for all you know he may be on the track of a masterpiece; but
observe: if it happens to be one nobody will see it.&nbsp; It can
be only for himself.&nbsp; And even he won&rsquo;t be able to see
it in its completeness except on his death-bed.&nbsp; There is
something fine in that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had blushed with pleasure; such fine ideas had never entered
my head.&nbsp; But there was something fine. . . . How far all
this seemed!&nbsp; How mute and how still!&nbsp; What a phantom
he was, that man with a beard of at least seven tones of
brown.&nbsp; And those shades of the other kind such as Baptiste
with the shaven diplomatic face, the <i>ma&icirc;tre
d&rsquo;h&ocirc;tel</i> in charge of the <i>petit salon</i>,
taking my hat and stick from me with a deferential remark:
&ldquo;Monsieur is not very often seen nowadays.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
those other well-groomed heads raised and nodding at my
passage&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Bonjour</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Bonjour</i>&rdquo;&mdash;following me with interested
eyes; these young X.s and Z.s, low-toned, markedly discreet,
lounging up to my table on their way out with murmurs: &ldquo;Are
you well?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Will one see you anywhere this
evening?&rdquo;&mdash;not from curiosity, God forbid, but just
from friendliness; and passing on almost without waiting for an
answer.&nbsp; What had I to do with them, this elegant dust,
these moulds of provincial fashion?</p>
<p>I also often lunched with Do&ntilde;a Rita without
invitation.&nbsp; But that was now unthinkable.&nbsp; What had I
to do with a woman who allowed somebody else to make her cry and
then with an amazing lack of good feeling did her offensive
weeping on my shoulder?&nbsp; Obviously I could have nothing to
do with her.&nbsp; My five minutes&rsquo; meditation in the
middle of the bedroom came to an end without even a sigh.&nbsp;
The dead don&rsquo;t sigh, and for all practical purposes I was
that, except for the final consummation, the growing cold, the
<i>rigor mortis</i>&mdash;that blessed state!&nbsp; With measured
steps I crossed the landing to my sitting-room.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>
<p>The windows of that room gave out on the street of the Consuls
which as usual was silent.&nbsp; And the house itself below me
and above me was soundless, perfectly still.&nbsp; In general the
house was quiet, dumbly quiet, without resonances of any sort,
something like what one would imagine the interior of a convent
would be.&nbsp; I suppose it was very solidly built.&nbsp; Yet
that morning I missed in the stillness that feeling of security
and peace which ought to have been associated with it.&nbsp; It
is, I believe, generally admitted that the dead are glad to be at
rest.&nbsp; But I wasn&rsquo;t at rest.&nbsp; What was wrong with
that silence?&nbsp; There was something incongruous in that
peace.&nbsp; What was it that had got into that stillness?&nbsp;
Suddenly I remembered: the mother of Captain Blunt.</p>
<p>Why had she come all the way from Paris?&nbsp; And why should
I bother my head about it?&nbsp; H&rsquo;m&mdash;the Blunt
atmosphere, the reinforced Blunt vibration stealing through the
walls, through the thick walls and the almost more solid
stillness.&nbsp; Nothing to me, of course&mdash;the movements of
Mme. Blunt, <i>m&egrave;re</i>.&nbsp; It was maternal affection
which had brought her south by either the evening or morning
Rapide, to take anxious stock of the ravages of that
insomnia.&nbsp; Very good thing, insomnia, for a cavalry officer
perpetually on outpost duty, a real godsend, so to speak; but on
leave a truly devilish condition to be in.</p>
<p>The above sequence of thoughts was entirely unsympathetic and
it was followed by a feeling of satisfaction that I, at any rate,
was not suffering from insomnia.&nbsp; I could always sleep in
the end.&nbsp; In the end.&nbsp; Escape into a nightmare.&nbsp;
Wouldn&rsquo;t he revel in that if he could!&nbsp; But that
wasn&rsquo;t for him.&nbsp; He had to toss about open-eyed all
night and get up weary, weary.&nbsp; But oh, wasn&rsquo;t I
weary, too, waiting for a sleep without dreams.</p>
<p>I heard the door behind me open.&nbsp; I had been standing
with my face to the window and, I declare, not knowing what I was
looking at across the road&mdash;the Desert of Sahara or a wall
of bricks, a landscape of rivers and forests or only the
Consulate of Paraguay.&nbsp; But I had been thinking, apparently,
of Mr. Blunt with such intensity that when I saw him enter the
room it didn&rsquo;t really make much difference.&nbsp; When I
turned about the door behind him was already shut.&nbsp; He
advanced towards me, correct, supple, hollow-eyed, and smiling;
and as to his costume ready to go out except for the old shooting
jacket which he must have affectioned particularly, for he never
lost any time in getting into it at every opportunity.&nbsp; Its
material was some tweed mixture; it had gone inconceivably
shabby, it was shrunk from old age, it was ragged at the elbows;
but any one could see at a glance that it had been made in London
by a celebrated tailor, by a distinguished specialist.&nbsp;
Blunt came towards me in all the elegance of his slimness and
affirming in every line of his face and body, in the correct set
of his shoulders and the careless freedom of his movements, the
superiority, the inexpressible superiority, the unconscious, the
unmarked, the not-to-be-described, and even not-to-be-caught,
superiority of the naturally born and the perfectly finished man
of the world, over the simple young man.&nbsp; He was smiling,
easy, correct, perfectly delightful, fit to kill.</p>
<p>He had come to ask me, if I had no other engagement, to lunch
with him and his mother in about an hour&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; He
did it in a most <i>d&eacute;gag&eacute;</i> tone.&nbsp; His
mother had given him a surprise.&nbsp; The completest . . . The
foundation of his mother&rsquo;s psychology was her delightful
unexpectedness.&nbsp; She could never let things be (this in a
peculiar tone which he checked at once) and he really would take
it very kindly of me if I came to break the
t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te for a while (that is if I had no
other engagement.&nbsp; Flash of teeth).&nbsp; His mother was
exquisitely and tenderly absurd.&nbsp; She had taken it into her
head that his health was endangered in some way.&nbsp; And when
she took anything into her head . . . Perhaps I might find
something to say which would reassure her.&nbsp; His mother had
two long conversations with Mills on his passage through Paris
and had heard of me (I knew how that thick man could speak of
people, he interjected ambiguously) and his mother, with an
insatiable curiosity for anything that was rare (filially
humorous accent here and a softer flash of teeth), was very
anxious to have me presented to her (courteous intonation, but no
teeth).&nbsp; He hoped I wouldn&rsquo;t mind if she treated me a
little as an &ldquo;interesting young man.&rdquo;&nbsp; His
mother had never got over her seventeenth year, and the manner of
the spoilt beauty of at least three counties at the back of the
Carolinas.&nbsp; That again got overlaid by the
<i>sans-fa&ccedil;on</i> of a <i>grande dame</i> of the Second
Empire.</p>
<p>I accepted the invitation with a worldly grin and a perfectly
just intonation, because I really didn&rsquo;t care what I
did.&nbsp; I only wondered vaguely why that fellow required all
the air in the room for himself.&nbsp; There did not seem enough
left to go down my throat.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t say that I would
come with pleasure or that I would be delighted, but I said that
I would come.&nbsp; He seemed to forget his tongue in his head,
put his hands in his pockets and moved about vaguely.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am a little nervous this morning,&rdquo; he said in
French, stopping short and looking me straight in the eyes.&nbsp;
His own were deep sunk, dark, fatal.&nbsp; I asked with some
malice, that no one could have detected in my intonation,
&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that sleeplessness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He muttered through his teeth, &ldquo;<i>Mal</i>.&nbsp; <i>Je
ne dors plus</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; He moved off to stand at the
window with his back to the room.&nbsp; I sat down on a sofa that
was there and put my feet up, and silence took possession of the
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this street ridiculous?&rdquo; said Blunt
suddenly, and crossing the room rapidly waved his hand to me,
&ldquo;<i>A bient&ocirc;t donc</i>,&rdquo; and was gone.&nbsp; He
had seared himself into my mind.&nbsp; I did not understand him
nor his mother then; which made them more impressive; but I have
discovered since that those two figures required no mystery to
make them memorable.&nbsp; Of course it isn&rsquo;t every day
that one meets a mother that lives by her wits and a son that
lives by his sword, but there was a perfect finish about their
ambiguous personalities which is not to be met twice in a
life-time.&nbsp; I shall never forget that grey dress with ample
skirts and long corsage yet with infinite style, the ancient as
if ghostly beauty of outlines, the black lace, the silver hair,
the harmonious, restrained movements of those white, soft hands
like the hands of a queen&mdash;or an abbess; and in the general
fresh effect of her person the brilliant eyes like two stars with
the calm reposeful way they had of moving on and off one, as if
nothing in the world had the right to veil itself before their
once sovereign beauty.&nbsp; Captain Blunt with smiling formality
introduced me by name, adding with a certain relaxation of the
formal tone the comment: &ldquo;The Monsieur George! whose fame
you tell me has reached even Paris.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs.
Blunt&rsquo;s reception of me, glance, tones, even to the
attitude of the admirably corseted figure, was most friendly,
approaching the limit of half-familiarity.&nbsp; I had the
feeling that I was beholding in her a captured ideal.&nbsp; No
common experience!&nbsp; But I didn&rsquo;t care.&nbsp; It was
very lucky perhaps for me that in a way I was like a very sick
man who has yet preserved all his lucidity.&nbsp; I was not even
wondering to myself at what on earth I was doing there.&nbsp; She
breathed out: &ldquo;<i>Comme c&rsquo;est romantique</i>,&rdquo;
at large to the dusty studio as it were; then pointing to a chair
at her right hand, and bending slightly towards me she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard this name murmured by pretty lips in more
than one royalist salon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say anything to that ingratiating speech.&nbsp;
I had only an odd thought that she could not have had such a
figure, nothing like it, when she was seventeen and wore snowy
muslin dresses on the family plantation in South Carolina, in
pre-abolition days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t mind, I am sure, if an old woman whose
heart is still young elects to call you by it,&rdquo; she
declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, Madame.&nbsp; It will be more
romantic,&rdquo; I assented with a respectful bow.</p>
<p>She dropped a calm: &ldquo;Yes&mdash;there is nothing like
romance while one is young.&nbsp; So I will call you Monsieur
George,&rdquo; she paused and then added, &ldquo;I could never
get old,&rdquo; in a matter-of-fact final tone as one would
remark, &ldquo;I could never learn to swim,&rdquo; and I had the
presence of mind to say in a tone to match, &ldquo;<i>C&rsquo;est
&eacute;vident</i>, Madame.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was evident.&nbsp;
She couldn&rsquo;t get old; and across the table her
thirty-year-old son who couldn&rsquo;t get sleep sat listening
with courteous detachment and the narrowest possible line of
white underlining his silky black moustache.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your services are immensely appreciated,&rdquo; she
said with an amusing touch of importance as of a great official
lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;Immensely appreciated by people in a position
to understand the great significance of the Carlist movement in
the South.&nbsp; There it has to combat anarchism, too.&nbsp; I
who have lived through the Commune . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Therese came in with a dish, and for the rest of the lunch the
conversation so well begun drifted amongst the most appalling
inanities of the religious-royalist-legitimist order.&nbsp; The
ears of all the Bourbons in the world must have been
burning.&nbsp; Mrs. Blunt seemed to have come into personal
contact with a good many of them and the marvellous insipidity of
her recollections was astonishing to my inexperience.&nbsp; I
looked at her from time to time thinking: She has seen slavery,
she has seen the Commune, she knows two continents, she has seen
a civil war, the glory of the Second Empire, the horrors of two
sieges; she has been in contact with marked personalities, with
great events, she has lived on her wealth, on her personality,
and there she is with her plumage unruffled, as glossy as ever,
unable to get old:&mdash;a sort of Phoenix free from the
slightest signs of ashes and dust, all complacent amongst those
inanities as if there had been nothing else in the world.&nbsp;
In my youthful haste I asked myself what sort of airy soul she
had.</p>
<p>At last Therese put a dish of fruit on the table, a small
collection of oranges, raisins, and nuts.&nbsp; No doubt she had
bought that lot very cheap and it did not look at all
inviting.&nbsp; Captain Blunt jumped up.&nbsp; &ldquo;My mother
can&rsquo;t stand tobacco smoke.&nbsp; Will you keep her company,
<i>mon cher</i>, while I take a turn with a cigar in that
ridiculous garden.&nbsp; The brougham from the hotel will be here
very soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He left us in the white flash of an apologetic grin.&nbsp;
Almost directly he reappeared, visible from head to foot through
the glass side of the studio, pacing up and down the central path
of that &ldquo;ridiculous&rdquo; garden: for its elegance and its
air of good breeding the most remarkable figure that I have ever
seen before or since.&nbsp; He had changed his coat.&nbsp; Madame
Blunt <i>m&egrave;re</i> lowered the long-handled glasses through
which she had been contemplating him with an appraising, absorbed
expression which had nothing maternal in it.&nbsp; But what she
said to me was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You understand my anxieties while he is campaigning
with the King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had spoken in French and she had used the expression
&ldquo;<i>mes transes</i>&rdquo; but for all the rest,
intonation, bearing, solemnity, she might have been referring to
one of the Bourbons.&nbsp; I am sure that not a single one of
them looked half as aristocratic as her son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand perfectly, Madame.&nbsp; But then that
life is so romantic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hundreds of young men belonging to a certain sphere are
doing that,&rdquo; she said very distinctly, &ldquo;only their
case is different.&nbsp; They have their positions, their
families to go back to; but we are different.&nbsp; We are
exiles, except of course for the ideals, the kindred spirit, the
friendships of old standing we have in France.&nbsp; Should my
son come out unscathed he has no one but me and I have no one but
him.&nbsp; I have to think of his life.&nbsp; Mr. Mills (what a
distinguished mind that is!) has reassured me as to my
son&rsquo;s health.&nbsp; But he sleeps very badly, doesn&rsquo;t
he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I murmured something affirmative in a doubtful tone and she
remarked quaintly, with a certain curtness, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so
unnecessary, this worry!&nbsp; The unfortunate position of an
exile has its advantages.&nbsp; At a certain height of social
position (wealth has got nothing to do with it, we have been
ruined in a most righteous cause), at a certain established
height one can disregard narrow prejudices.&nbsp; You see
examples in the aristocracies of all the countries.&nbsp; A
chivalrous young American may offer his life for a remote ideal
which yet may belong to his familial tradition.&nbsp; We, in our
great country, have every sort of tradition.&nbsp; But a young
man of good connections and distinguished relations must settle
down some day, dispose of his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt, Madame,&rdquo; I said, raising my eyes to the
figure outside&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Am&eacute;ricain</i>,
<i>Catholique et gentilhomme</i>&rdquo;&mdash;walking up and down
the path with a cigar which he was not smoking.&nbsp; &ldquo;For
myself, I don&rsquo;t know anything about those
necessities.&nbsp; I have broken away for ever from those
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Mills talked to me about you.&nbsp; What a
golden heart that is.&nbsp; His sympathies are
infinite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought suddenly of Mills pronouncing on Mme. Blunt,
whatever his text on me might have been: &ldquo;She lives by her
wits.&rdquo;&nbsp; Was she exercising her wits on me for some
purpose of her own?&nbsp; And I observed coldly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really know your son so very little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>voyons</i>,&rdquo; she protested.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
am aware that you are very much younger, but the similitudes of
opinions, origins and perhaps at bottom, faintly, of character,
of chivalrous devotion&mdash;no, you must be able to understand
him in a measure.&nbsp; He is infinitely scrupulous and
recklessly brave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I listened deferentially to the end yet with every nerve in my
body tingling in hostile response to the Blunt vibration, which
seemed to have got into my very hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am convinced of it, Madame.&nbsp; I have even heard
of your son&rsquo;s bravery.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s extremely natural
in a man who, in his own words, &lsquo;lives by his
sword.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She suddenly departed from her almost inhuman perfection,
betrayed &ldquo;nerves&rdquo; like a common mortal, of course
very slightly, but in her it meant more than a blaze of fury from
a vessel of inferior clay.&nbsp; Her admirable little foot,
marvellously shod in a black shoe, tapped the floor
irritably.&nbsp; But even in that display there was something
exquisitely delicate.&nbsp; The very anger in her voice was
silvery, as it were, and more like the petulance of a
seventeen-year-old beauty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What nonsense!&nbsp; A Blunt doesn&rsquo;t hire
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some princely families,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;were
founded by men who have done that very thing.&nbsp; The great
Condottieri, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was in an almost tempestuous tone that she made me observe
that we were not living in the fifteenth century.&nbsp; She gave
me also to understand with some spirit that there was no question
here of founding a family.&nbsp; Her son was very far from being
the first of the name.&nbsp; His importance lay rather in being
the last of a race which had totally perished, she added in a
completely drawing-room tone, &ldquo;in our Civil War.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had mastered her irritation and through the glass side of
the room sent a wistful smile to his address, but I noticed the
yet unextinguished anger in her eyes full of fire under her
beautiful white eyebrows.&nbsp; For she was growing old!&nbsp;
Oh, yes, she was growing old, and secretly weary, and perhaps
desperate.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>
<p>Without caring much about it I was conscious of sudden
illumination.&nbsp; I said to myself confidently that these two
people had been quarrelling all the morning.&nbsp; I had
discovered the secret of my invitation to that lunch.&nbsp; They
did not care to face the strain of some obstinate, inconclusive
discussion for fear, maybe, of it ending in a serious
quarrel.&nbsp; And so they had agreed that I should be fetched
downstairs to create a diversion.&nbsp; I cannot say I felt
annoyed.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t care.&nbsp; My perspicacity did not
please me either.&nbsp; I wished they had left me alone&mdash;but
nothing mattered.&nbsp; They must have been in their superiority
accustomed to make use of people, without compunction.&nbsp; From
necessity, too.&nbsp; She especially.&nbsp; She lived by her
wits.&nbsp; The silence had grown so marked that I had at last to
raise my eyes; and the first thing I observed was that Captain
Blunt was no longer to be seen in the garden.&nbsp; Must have
gone indoors.&nbsp; Would rejoin us in a moment.&nbsp; Then I
would leave mother and son to themselves.</p>
<p>The next thing I noticed was that a great mellowness had
descended upon the mother of the last of his race.&nbsp; But
these terms, irritation, mellowness, appeared gross when applied
to her.&nbsp; It is impossible to give an idea of the refinement
and subtlety of all her transformations.&nbsp; She smiled faintly
at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But all this is beside the point.&nbsp; The real point
is that my son, like all fine natures, is a being of strange
contradictions which the trials of life have not yet reconciled
in him.&nbsp; With me it is a little different.&nbsp; The trials
fell mainly to my share&mdash;and of course I have lived
longer.&nbsp; And then men are much more complex than women, much
more difficult, too.&nbsp; And you, Monsieur George?&nbsp; Are
you complex, with unexpected resistances and difficulties in your
<i>&ecirc;tre intime</i>&mdash;your inner self?&nbsp; I wonder
now . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Blunt atmosphere seemed to vibrate all over my skin.&nbsp;
I disregarded the symptom.&nbsp; &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;I have never tried to find out what sort of being I
am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s very wrong.&nbsp; We ought to reflect
on what manner of beings we are.&nbsp; Of course we are all
sinners.&nbsp; My John is a sinner like the others,&rdquo; she
declared further, with a sort of proud tenderness as though our
common lot must have felt honoured and to a certain extent
purified by this condescending recognition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are too young perhaps as yet . . . But as to my
John,&rdquo; she broke off, leaning her elbow on the table and
supporting her head on her old, impeccably shaped, white fore-arm
emerging from a lot of precious, still older, lace trimming the
short sleeve.&nbsp; &ldquo;The trouble is that he suffers from a
profound discord between the necessary reactions to life and even
the impulses of nature and the lofty idealism of his feelings; I
may say, of his principles.&nbsp; I assure you that he
won&rsquo;t even let his heart speak uncontradicted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am sure I don&rsquo;t know what particular devil looks after
the associations of memory, and I can&rsquo;t even imagine the
shock which it would have been for Mrs. Blunt to learn that the
words issuing from her lips had awakened in me the visual
perception of a dark-skinned, hard-driven lady&rsquo;s maid with
tarnished eyes; even of the tireless Rose handing me my hat while
breathing out the enigmatic words: &ldquo;Madame should listen to
her heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; A wave from the atmosphere of another
house rolled in, overwhelming and fiery, seductive and cruel,
through the Blunt vibration, bursting through it as through
tissue paper and filling my heart with sweet murmurs and
distracting images, till it seemed to break, leaving an empty
stillness in my breast.</p>
<p>After that for a long time I heard Mme. Blunt
<i>m&egrave;re</i> talking with extreme fluency and I even caught
the individual words, but I could not in the revulsion of my
feelings get hold of the sense.&nbsp; She talked apparently of
life in general, of its difficulties, moral and physical, of its
surprising turns, of its unexpected contacts, of the choice and
rare personalities that drift on it as if on the sea; of the
distinction that letters and art gave to it, the nobility and
consolations there are in aesthetics, of the privileges they
confer on individuals and (this was the first connected statement
I caught) that Mills agreed with her in the general point of view
as to the inner worth of individualities and in the particular
instance of it on which she had opened to him her innermost
heart.&nbsp; Mills had a universal mind.&nbsp; His sympathy was
universal, too.&nbsp; He had that large comprehension&mdash;oh,
not cynical, not at all cynical, in fact rather
tender&mdash;which was found in its perfection only in some rare,
very rare Englishmen.&nbsp; The dear creature was romantic,
too.&nbsp; Of course he was reserved in his speech but she
understood Mills perfectly.&nbsp; Mills apparently liked me very
much.</p>
<p>It was time for me to say something.&nbsp; There was a
challenge in the reposeful black eyes resting upon my face.&nbsp;
I murmured that I was very glad to hear it.&nbsp; She waited a
little, then uttered meaningly, &ldquo;Mr. Mills is a little bit
uneasy about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very good of him,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; And
indeed I thought that it was very good of him, though I did ask
myself vaguely in my dulled brain why he should be uneasy.</p>
<p>Somehow it didn&rsquo;t occur to me to ask Mrs. Blunt.&nbsp;
Whether she had expected me to do so or not I don&rsquo;t know
but after a while she changed the pose she had kept so long and
folded her wonderfully preserved white arms.&nbsp; She looked a
perfect picture in silver and grey, with touches of black here
and there.&nbsp; Still I said nothing more in my dull
misery.&nbsp; She waited a little longer, then she woke me up
with a crash.&nbsp; It was as if the house had fallen, and yet
she had only asked me:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you are received on very friendly terms by
Madame de Lastaola on account of your common exertions for the
cause.&nbsp; Very good friends, are you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean Rita,&rdquo; I said stupidly, but I felt
stupid, like a man who wakes up only to be hit on the head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Rita,&rdquo; she repeated with unexpected acidity,
which somehow made me feel guilty of an incredible breach of good
manners.&nbsp; &ldquo;H&rsquo;m, Rita. . . . Oh, well, let it be
Rita&mdash;for the present.&nbsp; Though why she should be
deprived of her name in conversation about her, really I
don&rsquo;t understand.&nbsp; Unless a very special intimacy . .
.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was distinctly annoyed.&nbsp; I said sulkily, &ldquo;It
isn&rsquo;t her name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is her choice, I understand, which seems almost a
better title to recognition on the part of the world.&nbsp; It
didn&rsquo;t strike you so before?&nbsp; Well, it seems to me
that choice has got more right to be respected than heredity or
law.&nbsp; Moreover, Mme. de Lastaola,&rdquo; she continued in an
insinuating voice, &ldquo;that most rare and fascinating young
woman is, as a friend like you cannot deny, outside legality
altogether.&nbsp; Even in that she is an exceptional
creature.&nbsp; For she is exceptional&mdash;you
agree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had gone dumb, I could only stare at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see, you agree.&nbsp; No friend of hers could
deny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; I burst out, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
where a question of friendship comes in here with a person whom
you yourself call so exceptional.&nbsp; I really don&rsquo;t know
how she looks upon me.&nbsp; Our intercourse is of course very
close and confidential.&nbsp; Is that also talked about in
Paris?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all, not in the least,&rdquo; said Mrs. Blunt,
easy, equable, but with her calm, sparkling eyes holding me in
angry subjection.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nothing of the sort is being
talked about.&nbsp; The references to Mme. de Lastaola are in a
very different tone, I can assure you, thanks to her discretion
in remaining here.&nbsp; And, I must say, thanks to the discreet
efforts of her friends.&nbsp; I am also a friend of Mme. de
Lastaola, you must know.&nbsp; Oh, no, I have never spoken to her
in my life and have seen her only twice, I believe.&nbsp; I wrote
to her though, that I admit.&nbsp; She or rather the image of her
has come into my life, into that part of it where art and letters
reign undisputed like a sort of religion of beauty to which I
have been faithful through all the vicissitudes of my
existence.&nbsp; Yes, I did write to her and I have been
preoccupied with her for a long time.&nbsp; It arose from a
picture, from two pictures and also from a phrase pronounced by a
man, who in the science of life and in the perception of
aesthetic truth had no equal in the world of culture.&nbsp; He
said that there was something in her of the women of all
time.&nbsp; I suppose he meant the inheritance of all the gifts
that make up an irresistible fascination&mdash;a great
personality.&nbsp; Such women are not born often.&nbsp; Most of
them lack opportunities.&nbsp; They never develop.&nbsp; They end
obscurely.&nbsp; Here and there one survives to make her mark
even in history. . . . And even that is not a very enviable
fate.&nbsp; They are at another pole from the so-called dangerous
women who are merely coquettes.&nbsp; A coquette has got to work
for her success.&nbsp; The others have nothing to do but simply
exist.&nbsp; You perceive the view I take of the
difference?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I perceived the view.&nbsp; I said to myself that nothing in
the world could be more aristocratic.&nbsp; This was the
slave-owning woman who had never worked, even if she had been
reduced to live by her wits.&nbsp; She was a wonderful old
woman.&nbsp; She made me dumb.&nbsp; She held me fascinated by
the well-bred attitude, something sublimely aloof in her air of
wisdom.</p>
<p>I just simply let myself go admiring her as though I had been
a mere slave of aesthetics: the perfect grace, the amazing poise
of that venerable head, the assured as if royal&mdash;yes, royal
even flow of the voice. . . . But what was it she was talking
about now?&nbsp; These were no longer considerations about fatal
women.&nbsp; She was talking about her son again.&nbsp; My
interest turned into mere bitterness of contemptuous
attention.&nbsp; For I couldn&rsquo;t withhold it though I tried
to let the stuff go by.&nbsp; Educated in the most aristocratic
college in Paris . . . at eighteen . . . call of duty . . . with
General Lee to the very last cruel minute . . . after that
catastrophe end of the world&mdash;return to France&mdash;to old
friendships, infinite kindness&mdash;but a life hollow, without
occupation. . . Then 1870&mdash;and chivalrous response to
adopted country&rsquo;s call and again emptiness, the chafing of
a proud spirit without aim and handicapped not exactly by poverty
but by lack of fortune.&nbsp; And she, the mother, having to look
on at this wasting of a most accomplished man, of a most
chivalrous nature that practically had no future before it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You understand me well, Monsieur George.&nbsp; A nature
like this!&nbsp; It is the most refined cruelty of fate to look
at.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know whether I suffered more in times of
war or in times of peace.&nbsp; You understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I bowed my head in silence.&nbsp; What I couldn&rsquo;t
understand was why he delayed so long in joining us again.&nbsp;
Unless he had had enough of his mother?&nbsp; I thought without
any great resentment that I was being victimized; but then it
occurred to me that the cause of his absence was quite
simple.&nbsp; I was familiar enough with his habits by this time
to know that he often managed to snatch an hour&rsquo;s sleep or
so during the day.&nbsp; He had gone and thrown himself on his
bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I admire him exceedingly,&rdquo; Mrs. Blunt was saying
in a tone which was not at all maternal.&nbsp; &ldquo;His
distinction, his fastidiousness, the earnest warmth of his
heart.&nbsp; I know him well.&nbsp; I assure you that I would
never have dared to suggest,&rdquo; she continued with an
extraordinary haughtiness of attitude and tone that aroused my
attention, &ldquo;I would never have dared to put before him my
views of the extraordinary merits and the uncertain fate of the
exquisite woman of whom we speak, if I had not been certain that,
partly by my fault, I admit, his attention has been attracted to
her and his&mdash;his&mdash;his heart engaged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was as if some one had poured a bucket of cold water over
my head.&nbsp; I woke up with a great shudder to the acute
perception of my own feelings and of that aristocrat&rsquo;s
incredible purpose.&nbsp; How it could have germinated, grown and
matured in that exclusive soil was inconceivable.&nbsp; She had
been inciting her son all the time to undertake wonderful salvage
work by annexing the heiress of Henry All&egrave;gre&mdash;the
woman and the fortune.</p>
<p>There must have been an amazed incredulity in my eyes, to
which her own responded by an unflinching black brilliance which
suddenly seemed to develop a scorching quality even to the point
of making me feel extremely thirsty all of a sudden.&nbsp; For a
time my tongue literally clove to the roof of my mouth.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know whether it was an illusion but it seemed to me
that Mrs. Blunt had nodded at me twice as if to say: &ldquo;You
are right, that&rsquo;s so.&rdquo;&nbsp; I made an effort to
speak but it was very poor.&nbsp; If she did hear me it was
because she must have been on the watch for the faintest
sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His heart engaged.&nbsp; Like two hundred others, or
two thousand, all around,&rdquo; I mumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Altogether different.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s no
disparagement to a woman surely.&nbsp; Of course her great
fortune protects her in a certain measure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it?&rdquo; I faltered out and that time I really
doubt whether she heard me.&nbsp; Her aspect in my eyes had
changed.&nbsp; Her purpose being disclosed, her well-bred ease
appeared sinister, her aristocratic repose a treacherous device,
her venerable graciousness a mask of unbounded contempt for all
human beings whatever.&nbsp; She was a terrible old woman with
those straight, white wolfish eye-brows.&nbsp; How blind I had
been!&nbsp; Those eyebrows alone ought to have been enough to
give her away.&nbsp; Yet they were as beautifully smooth as her
voice when she admitted: &ldquo;That protection naturally is only
partial.&nbsp; There is the danger of her own self, poor
girl.&nbsp; She requires guidance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I marvelled at the villainy of my tone as I spoke, but it was
only assumed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she has done badly for herself, so
far,&rdquo; I forced myself to say.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose you
know that she began life by herding the village goats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the course of that phrase I noticed her wince just the
least bit.&nbsp; Oh, yes, she winced; but at the end of it she
smiled easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; So she told you her
story!&nbsp; Oh, well, I suppose you are very good friends.&nbsp;
A goatherd&mdash;really?&nbsp; In the fairy tale I believe the
girl that marries the prince is&mdash;what is it?&mdash;a
<i>gardeuse d&rsquo;oies</i>.&nbsp; And what a thing to drag out
against a woman.&nbsp; One might just as soon reproach any of
them for coming unclothed into the world.&nbsp; They all do, you
know.&nbsp; And then they become&mdash;what you will discover
when you have lived longer, Monsieur George&mdash;for the most
part futile creatures, without any sense of truth and beauty,
drudges of all sorts, or else dolls to dress.&nbsp; In a
word&mdash;ordinary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The implication of scorn in her tranquil manner was
immense.&nbsp; It seemed to condemn all those that were not born
in the Blunt connection.&nbsp; It was the perfect pride of
Republican aristocracy, which has no gradations and knows no
limit, and, as if created by the grace of God, thinks it ennobles
everything it touches: people, ideas, even passing tastes!</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many of them,&rdquo; pursued Mrs. Blunt,
&ldquo;have had the good fortune, the leisure to develop their
intelligence and their beauty in aesthetic conditions as this
charming woman had?&nbsp; Not one in a million.&nbsp; Perhaps not
one in an age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The heiress of Henry All&egrave;gre,&rdquo; I
murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely.&nbsp; But John wouldn&rsquo;t be marrying
the heiress of Henry All&egrave;gre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the first time that the frank word, the clear idea,
came into the conversation and it made me feel ill with a sort of
enraged faintness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would be Mme. de
Lastaola then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mme. la Comtesse de Lastaola as soon as she likes after
the success of this war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you believe in its success?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for a moment,&rdquo; I declared, and was surprised
to see her look pleased.</p>
<p>She was an aristocrat to the tips of her fingers; she really
didn&rsquo;t care for anybody.&nbsp; She had passed through the
Empire, she had lived through a siege, had rubbed shoulders with
the Commune, had seen everything, no doubt, of what men are
capable in the pursuit of their desires or in the extremity of
their distress, for love, for money, and even for honour; and in
her precarious connection with the very highest spheres she had
kept her own honourability unscathed while she had lost all her
prejudices.&nbsp; She was above all that.&nbsp; Perhaps
&ldquo;the world&rdquo; was the only thing that could have the
slightest checking influence; but when I ventured to say
something about the view it might take of such an alliance she
looked at me for a moment with visible surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Monsieur George, I have lived in the great
world all my life.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the best that there is, but
that&rsquo;s only because there is nothing merely decent
anywhere.&nbsp; It will accept anything, forgive anything, forget
anything in a few days.&nbsp; And after all who will he be
marrying?&nbsp; A charming, clever, rich and altogether uncommon
woman.&nbsp; What did the world hear of her?&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp;
The little it saw of her was in the Bois for a few hours every
year, riding by the side of a man of unique distinction and of
exclusive tastes, devoted to the cult of aesthetic impressions; a
man of whom, as far as aspect, manner, and behaviour goes, she
might have been the daughter.&nbsp; I have seen her myself.&nbsp;
I went on purpose.&nbsp; I was immensely struck.&nbsp; I was even
moved.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; She might have been&mdash;except for that
something radiant in her that marked her apart from all the other
daughters of men.&nbsp; The few remarkable personalities that
count in society and who were admitted into Henry
All&egrave;gre&rsquo;s Pavilion treated her with punctilious
reserve.&nbsp; I know that, I have made enquiries.&nbsp; I know
she sat there amongst them like a marvellous child, and for the
rest what can they say about her?&nbsp; That when abandoned to
herself by the death of All&egrave;gre she has made a
mistake?&nbsp; I think that any woman ought to be allowed one
mistake in her life.&nbsp; The worst they can say of her is that
she discovered it, that she had sent away a man in love directly
she found out that his love was not worth having; that she had
told him to go and look for his crown, and that, after dismissing
him she had remained generously faithful to his cause, in her
person and fortune.&nbsp; And this, you will allow, is rather
uncommon upon the whole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You make her out very magnificent,&rdquo;&nbsp; I
murmured, looking down upon the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; exclaimed the aristocratic Mrs.
Blunt, with an almost youthful ingenuousness, and in those black
eyes which looked at me so calmly there was a flash of the
Southern beauty, still na&iuml;ve and romantic, as if altogether
untouched by experience.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there
is a single grain of vulgarity in all her enchanting
person.&nbsp; Neither is there in my son.&nbsp; I suppose you
won&rsquo;t deny that he is uncommon.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely,&rdquo; I said in a perfectly conventional
tone, I was now on my mettle that she should not discover what
there was humanly common in my nature.&nbsp; She took my answer
at her own valuation and was satisfied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t fail to understand each other on the
very highest level of idealistic perceptions.&nbsp; Can you
imagine my John thrown away on some enamoured white goose out of
a stuffy old salon?&nbsp; Why, she couldn&rsquo;t even begin to
understand what he feels or what he needs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said impenetrably, &ldquo;he is not easy
to understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have reason to think,&rdquo; she said with a
suppressed smile, &ldquo;that he has a certain power over
women.&nbsp; Of course I don&rsquo;t know anything about his
intimate life but a whisper or two have reached me, like that,
floating in the air, and I could hardly suppose that he would
find an exceptional resistance in that quarter of all
others.&nbsp; But I should like to know the exact
degree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I disregarded an annoying tendency to feel dizzy that came
over me and was very careful in managing my voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask, Madame, why you are telling me all
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For two reasons,&rdquo; she condescended
graciously.&nbsp; &ldquo;First of all because Mr. Mills told me
that you were much more mature than one would expect.&nbsp; In
fact you look much younger than I was prepared for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; I interrupted her, &ldquo;I may have a
certain capacity for action and for responsibility, but as to the
regions into which this very unexpected conversation has taken me
I am a great novice.&nbsp; They are outside my interest.&nbsp; I
have had no experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make yourself out so hopeless,&rdquo; she
said in a spoilt-beauty tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have your
intuitions.&nbsp; At any rate you have a pair of eyes.&nbsp; You
are everlastingly over there, so I understand.&nbsp; Surely you
have seen how far they are . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>I interrupted again and this time bitterly, but always in a
tone of polite enquiry:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think her facile, Madame?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked offended.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think her most
fastidious.&nbsp; It is my son who is in question
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I understood then that she looked on her son as
irresistible.&nbsp; For my part I was just beginning to think
that it would be impossible for me to wait for his return.&nbsp;
I figured him to myself lying dressed on his bed sleeping like a
stone.&nbsp; But there was no denying that the mother was holding
me with an awful, tortured interest.&nbsp; Twice Therese had
opened the door, had put her small head in and drawn it back like
a tortoise.&nbsp; But for some time I had lost the sense of us
two being quite alone in the studio.&nbsp; I had perceived the
familiar dummy in its corner but it lay now on the floor as if
Therese had knocked it down angrily with a broom for a heathen
idol.&nbsp; It lay there prostrate, handless, without its head,
pathetic, like the mangled victim of a crime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John is fastidious, too,&rdquo; began Mrs. Blunt
again.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course you wouldn&rsquo;t suppose anything
vulgar in his resistances to a very real sentiment.&nbsp; One has
got to understand his psychology.&nbsp; He can&rsquo;t leave
himself in peace.&nbsp; He is exquisitely absurd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I recognized the phrase.&nbsp; Mother and son talked of each
other in identical terms.&nbsp; But perhaps &ldquo;exquisitely
absurd&rdquo; was the Blunt family saying?&nbsp; There are such
sayings in families and generally there is some truth in
them.&nbsp; Perhaps this old woman was simply absurd.&nbsp; She
continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had a most painful discussion all this
morning.&nbsp; He is angry with me for suggesting the very thing
his whole being desires.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t feel guilty.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s he who is tormenting himself with his infinite
scrupulosity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; I said, looking at the mangled dummy like
the model of some atrocious murder.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, the
fortune.&nbsp; But that can be left alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What nonsense!&nbsp; How is it possible?&nbsp; It
isn&rsquo;t contained in a bag, you can&rsquo;t throw it into the
sea.&nbsp; And moreover, it isn&rsquo;t her fault.&nbsp; I am
astonished that you should have thought of that vulgar
hypocrisy.&nbsp; No, it isn&rsquo;t her fortune that cheeks my
son; it&rsquo;s something much more subtle.&nbsp; Not so much her
history as her position.&nbsp; He is absurd.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t
what has happened in her life.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s her very freedom
that makes him torment himself and her, too&mdash;as far as I can
understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I suppressed a groan and said to myself that I must really get
away from there.</p>
<p>Mrs. Blunt was fairly launched now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For all his superiority he is a man of the world and
shares to a certain extent its current opinions.&nbsp; He has no
power over her.&nbsp; She intimidates him.&nbsp; He wishes he had
never set eyes on her.&nbsp; Once or twice this morning he looked
at me as if he could find it in his heart to hate his old
mother.&nbsp; There is no doubt about it&mdash;he loves her,
Monsieur George.&nbsp; He loves her, this poor, luckless, perfect
<i>homme du monde</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The silence lasted for some time and then I heard a murmur:
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a matter of the utmost delicacy between two
beings so sensitive, so proud.&nbsp; It has to be
managed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I found myself suddenly on my feet and saying with the utmost
politeness that I had to beg her permission to leave her alone as
I had an engagement; but she motioned me simply to sit
down&mdash;and I sat down again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you I had a request to make,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have understood from Mr. Mills that you have
been to the West Indies, that you have some interests
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was astounded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Interests!&nbsp; I certainly
have been there,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>She caught me up.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then why not go there
again?&nbsp; I am speaking to you frankly because . .
.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Madame, I am engaged in this affair with
Do&ntilde;a Rita, even if I had any interests elsewhere.&nbsp; I
won&rsquo;t tell you about the importance of my work.&nbsp; I
didn&rsquo;t suspect it but you brought the news of it to me, and
so I needn&rsquo;t point it out to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now we were frankly arguing with each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where will it lead you in the end?&nbsp; You have
all your life before you, all your plans, prospects, perhaps
dreams, at any rate your own tastes and all your life-time before
you.&nbsp; And would you sacrifice all this to&mdash;the
Pretender?&nbsp; A mere figure for the front page of illustrated
papers.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never think of him,&rdquo;&nbsp; I said curtly,
&ldquo;but I suppose Do&ntilde;a Rita&rsquo;s feelings,
instincts, call it what you like&mdash;or only her chivalrous
fidelity to her mistakes&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do&ntilde;a Rita&rsquo;s presence here in this town,
her withdrawal from the possible complications of her life in
Paris has produced an excellent effect on my son.&nbsp; It
simplifies infinite difficulties, I mean moral as well as
material.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s extremely to the advantage of her
dignity, of her future, and of her peace of mind.&nbsp; But I am
thinking, of course, mainly of my son.&nbsp; He is most
exacting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt extremely sick at heart.&nbsp; &ldquo;And so I am to
drop everything and vanish,&rdquo; I said, rising from my chair
again.&nbsp; And this time Mrs. Blunt got up, too, with a lofty
and inflexible manner but she didn&rsquo;t dismiss me yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said distinctly.&nbsp; &ldquo;All this,
my dear Monsieur George, is such an accident.&nbsp; What have you
got to do here?&nbsp; You look to me like somebody who would find
adventures wherever he went as interesting and perhaps less
dangerous than this one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She slurred over the word dangerous but I picked it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you know of its dangers, Madame, may I
ask?&rdquo;&nbsp; But she did not condescend to hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then you, too, have your chivalrous
feelings,&rdquo; she went on, unswerving, distinct, and
tranquil.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are not absurd.&nbsp; But my son
is.&nbsp; He would shut her up in a convent for a time if he
could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t the only one,&rdquo; I muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; she was startled, then lower,
&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; That woman must be the centre of all sorts of
passions,&rdquo; she mused audibly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But what have
you got to do with all this?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s nothing to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She waited for me to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly, Madame,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and therefore I
don&rsquo;t see why I should concern myself in all this one way
or another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she assented with a weary air, &ldquo;except
that you might ask yourself what is the good of tormenting a man
of noble feelings, however absurd.&nbsp; His Southern blood makes
him very violent sometimes.&nbsp; I fear&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; And
then for the first time during this conversation, for the first
time since I left Do&ntilde;a Rita the day before, for the first
time I laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to hint, Madame, that Southern gentlemen
are dead shots?&nbsp; I am aware of that&mdash;from
novels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I spoke looking her straight in the face and I made that
exquisite, aristocratic old woman positively blink by my
directness.&nbsp; There was a faint flush on her delicate old
cheeks but she didn&rsquo;t move a muscle of her face.&nbsp; I
made her a most respectful bow and went out of the studio.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>
<p>Through the great arched window of the hall I saw the hotel
brougham waiting at the door.&nbsp; On passing the door of the
front room (it was originally meant for a drawing-room but a bed
for Blunt was put in there) I banged with my fist on the panel
and shouted: &ldquo;I am obliged to go out.&nbsp; Your
mother&rsquo;s carriage is at the door.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
didn&rsquo;t think he was asleep.&nbsp; My view now was that he
was aware beforehand of the subject of the conversation, and if
so I did not wish to appear as if I had slunk away from him after
the interview.&nbsp; But I didn&rsquo;t stop&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t
want to see him&mdash;and before he could answer I was already
half way up the stairs running noiselessly up the thick carpet
which also covered the floor of the landing.&nbsp; Therefore
opening the door of my sitting-room quickly I caught by surprise
the person who was in there watching the street half concealed by
the window curtain.&nbsp; It was a woman.&nbsp; A totally
unexpected woman.&nbsp; A perfect stranger.&nbsp; She came away
quickly to meet me.&nbsp; Her face was veiled and she was dressed
in a dark walking costume and a very simple form of hat.&nbsp;
She murmured: &ldquo;I had an idea that Monsieur was in the
house,&rdquo; raising a gloved hand to lift her veil.&nbsp; It
was Rose and she gave me a shock.&nbsp; I had never seen her
before but with her little black silk apron and a white cap with
ribbons on her head.&nbsp; This outdoor dress was like a
disguise.&nbsp; I asked anxiously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has happened to Madame?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&nbsp; I have a letter,&rdquo; she murmured,
and I saw it appear between the fingers of her extended hand, in
a very white envelope which I tore open impatiently.&nbsp; It
consisted of a few lines only.&nbsp; It began abruptly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are gone to sea then I can&rsquo;t forgive you
for not sending the usual word at the last moment.&nbsp; If you
are not gone why don&rsquo;t you come?&nbsp; Why did you leave me
yesterday?&nbsp; You leave me crying&mdash;I who haven&rsquo;t
cried for years and years, and you haven&rsquo;t the sense to
come back within the hour, within twenty hours!&nbsp; This
conduct is idiotic&rdquo;&mdash;and a sprawling signature of the
four magic letters at the bottom.</p>
<p>While I was putting the letter in my pocket the girl said in
an earnest undertone: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to leave Madame
by herself for any length of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long have you been in my room?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The time seemed long.&nbsp; I hope Monsieur won&rsquo;t
mind the liberty.&nbsp; I sat for a little in the hall but then
it struck me I might be seen.&nbsp; In fact, Madame told me not
to be seen if I could help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did she tell you that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I permitted myself to suggest that to Madame.&nbsp; It
might have given a false impression.&nbsp; Madame is frank and
open like the day but it won&rsquo;t do with everybody.&nbsp;
There are people who would put a wrong construction on
anything.&nbsp; Madame&rsquo;s sister told me Monsieur was
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you didn&rsquo;t believe her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Non</i>, Monsieur.&nbsp; I have lived with
Madame&rsquo;s sister for nearly a week when she first came into
this house.&nbsp; She wanted me to leave the message, but I said
I would wait a little.&nbsp; Then I sat down in the big
porter&rsquo;s chair in the hall and after a while, everything
being very quiet, I stole up here.&nbsp; I know the disposition
of the apartments.&nbsp; I reckoned Madame&rsquo;s sister would
think that I got tired of waiting and let myself out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have been amusing yourself watching the street
ever since?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The time seemed long,&rdquo; she answered
evasively.&nbsp; &ldquo;An empty <i>coup&eacute;</i> came to the
door about an hour ago and it&rsquo;s still waiting,&rdquo; she
added, looking at me inquisitively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are some dancing girls staying in the
house,&rdquo; I said negligently.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you leave
Madame alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the gardener and his wife in the
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those people keep at the back.&nbsp; Is Madame
alone?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what I want to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur forgets that I have been three hours away; but
I assure Monsieur that here in this town it&rsquo;s perfectly
safe for Madame to be alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And wouldn&rsquo;t it be anywhere else?&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s the first I hear of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Paris, in our apartments in the hotel, it&rsquo;s
all right, too; but in the Pavilion, for instance, I
wouldn&rsquo;t leave Madame by herself, not for half an
hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is there in the Pavilion?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sort of feeling I have,&rdquo; she
murmured reluctantly . . . &ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s that
<i>coup&eacute;</i> going away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made a movement towards the window but checked
herself.&nbsp; I hadn&rsquo;t moved.&nbsp; The rattle of wheels
on the cobble-stones died out almost at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will Monsieur write an answer?&rdquo; Rose suggested
after a short silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly worth while,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will
be there very soon after you.&nbsp; Meantime, please tell Madame
from me that I am not anxious to see any more tears.&nbsp; Tell
her this just like that, you understand.&nbsp; I will take the
risk of not being received.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She dropped her eyes, said: &ldquo;<i>Oui</i>,
Monsieur,&rdquo; and at my suggestion waited, holding the door of
the room half open, till I went downstairs to see the road
clear.</p>
<p>It was a kind of deaf-and-dumb house.&nbsp; The
black-and-white hall was empty and everything was perfectly
still.&nbsp; Blunt himself had no doubt gone away with his mother
in the brougham, but as to the others, the dancing girls,
Therese, or anybody else that its walls may have contained, they
might have been all murdering each other in perfect assurance
that the house would not betray them by indulging in any unseemly
murmurs.&nbsp; I emitted a low whistle which didn&rsquo;t seem to
travel in that peculiar atmosphere more than two feet away from
my lips, but all the same Rose came tripping down the stairs at
once.&nbsp; With just a nod to my whisper: &ldquo;Take a
fiacre,&rdquo; she glided out and I shut the door noiselessly
behind her.</p>
<p>The next time I saw her she was opening the door of the house
on the Prado to me, with her cap and the little black silk apron
on, and with that marked personality of her own, which had been
concealed so perfectly in the dowdy walking dress, very much to
the fore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have given Madame the message,&rdquo; she said in her
contained voice, swinging the door wide open.&nbsp; Then after
relieving me of my hat and coat she announced me with the simple
words: &ldquo;<i>Voil&agrave;</i> Monsieur,&rdquo; and hurried
away.&nbsp; Directly I appeared Do&ntilde;a Rita, away there on
the couch, passed the tips of her fingers over her eyes and
holding her hands up palms outwards on each side of her head,
shouted to me down the whole length of the room: &ldquo;The dry
season has set in.&rdquo;&nbsp; I glanced at the pink tips of her
fingers perfunctorily and then drew back.&nbsp; She let her hands
fall negligently as if she had no use for them any more and put
on a serious expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it seems,&rdquo; I said, sitting down opposite
her.&nbsp; &ldquo;For how long, I wonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For years and years.&nbsp; One gets so little
encouragement.&nbsp; First you bolt away from my tears, then you
send an impertinent message, and then when you come at last you
pretend to behave respectfully, though you don&rsquo;t know how
to do it.&nbsp; You should sit much nearer the edge of the chair
and hold yourself very stiff, and make it quite clear that you
don&rsquo;t know what to do with your hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this in a fascinating voice with a ripple of badinage that
seemed to play upon the sober surface of her thoughts.&nbsp; Then
seeing that I did not answer she altered the note a bit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Amigo</i> George,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I take the
trouble to send for you and here I am before you, talking to you
and you say nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What am I to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I tell?&nbsp; You might say a thousand
things.&nbsp; You might, for instance, tell me that you were
sorry for my tears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might also tell you a thousand lies.&nbsp; What do I
know about your tears?&nbsp; I am not a susceptible idiot.&nbsp;
It all depends upon the cause.&nbsp; There are tears of quiet
happiness.&nbsp; Peeling onions also will bring tears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are not susceptible,&rdquo; she flew out at
me.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you are an idiot all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it to tell me this that you have written to me to
come?&rdquo; I asked with a certain animation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; And if you had as much sense as the talking
parrot I owned once you would have read between the lines that
all I wanted you here for was to tell you what I think of
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, tell me what you think of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would in a moment if I could be half as impertinent
as you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What unexpected modesty,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These, I suppose, are your sea manners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t put up with half that nonsense from
anybody at sea.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you remember you told me
yourself to go away?&nbsp; What was I to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How stupid you are.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mean that you
pretend.&nbsp; You really are.&nbsp; Do you understand what I
say?&nbsp; I will spell it for you.&nbsp; S-t-u-p-i-d.&nbsp; Ah,
now I feel better.&nbsp; Oh, <i>amigo</i> George, my dear
fellow-conspirator for the king&mdash;the king.&nbsp; Such a
king!&nbsp; <i>Vive le Roi</i>!&nbsp; Come, why don&rsquo;t you
shout <i>Vive le Roi</i>, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not your parrot,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he never sulked.&nbsp; He was a charming,
good-mannered bird, accustomed to the best society, whereas you,
I suppose, are nothing but a heartless vagabond like
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay you are, but I suppose nobody had the
insolence to tell you that to your face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, very nearly.&nbsp; It was what it amounted
to.&nbsp; I am not stupid.&nbsp; There is no need to spell out
simple words for me.&nbsp; It just came out.&nbsp; Don Juan
struggled desperately to keep the truth in.&nbsp; It was most
pathetic.&nbsp; And yet he couldn&rsquo;t help himself.&nbsp; He
talked very much like a parrot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of the best society,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the most honourable of parrots.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t like parrot-talk.&nbsp; It sounds so uncanny.&nbsp;
Had I lived in the Middle Ages I am certain I would have believed
that a talking bird must be possessed by the devil.&nbsp; I am
sure Therese would believe that now.&nbsp; My own sister!&nbsp;
She would cross herself many times and simply quake with
terror.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you were not terrified,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;May I ask when that interesting communication took
place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday, just before you blundered in here of all
days in the year.&nbsp; I was sorry for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why tell me this?&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t help noticing
it.&nbsp; I regretted I hadn&rsquo;t my umbrella with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those unforgiven tears!&nbsp; Oh, you simple
soul!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you know that people never cry for
anybody but themselves? . . . <i>Amigo</i> George, tell
me&mdash;what are we doing in this world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean all the people, everybody?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, only people like you and me.&nbsp; Simple people,
in this world which is eaten up with charlatanism of all sorts so
that even we, the simple, don&rsquo;t know any longer how to
trust each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t we?&nbsp; Then why don&rsquo;t you trust
him?&nbsp; You are dying to do so, don&rsquo;t you
know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She dropped her chin on her breast and from under her straight
eyebrows the deep blue eyes remained fixed on me, impersonally,
as if without thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you been doing since you left me
yesterday?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first thing I remember I abused your sister
horribly this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how did she take it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a warm shower in spring.&nbsp; She drank it all in
and unfolded her petals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What poetical expressions he uses!&nbsp; That girl is
more perverted than one would think possible, considering what
she is and whence she came.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s true that I, too,
come from the same spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is slightly crazy.&nbsp; I am a great favourite
with her.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t say this to boast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be very comforting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it has cheered me immensely.&nbsp; Then after a
morning of delightful musings on one thing and another I went to
lunch with a charming lady and spent most of the afternoon
talking with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Rita raised her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lady!&nbsp; Women seem such mysterious creatures to
me.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know them.&nbsp; Did you abuse her?&nbsp;
Did she&mdash;how did you say that?&mdash;unfold her petals,
too?&nbsp; Was she really and truly . . .?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is simply perfection in her way and the
conversation was by no means banal.&nbsp; I fancy that if your
late parrot had heard it, he would have fallen off his
perch.&nbsp; For after all, in that All&egrave;gre Pavilion, my
dear Rita, you were but a crowd of glorified
<i>bourgeois</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was beautifully animated now.&nbsp; In her motionless blue
eyes like melted sapphires, around those red lips that almost
without moving could breathe enchanting sounds into the world,
there was a play of light, that mysterious ripple of gaiety that
seemed always to run and faintly quiver under her skin even in
her gravest moods; just as in her rare moments of gaiety its
warmth and radiance seemed to come to one through infinite
sadness, like the sunlight of our life hiding the invincible
darkness in which the universe must work out its impenetrable
destiny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I think of it! . . . Perhaps that&rsquo;s the
reason I never could feel perfectly serious while they were
demolishing the world about my ears.&nbsp; I fancy now that I
could tell beforehand what each of them was going to say.&nbsp;
They were repeating the same words over and over again, those
great clever men, very much like parrots who also seem to know
what they say.&nbsp; That doesn&rsquo;t apply to the master of
the house, who never talked much.&nbsp; He sat there mostly
silent and looming up three sizes bigger than any of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ruler of the aviary,&rdquo; I muttered
viciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It annoys you that I should talk of that time?&rdquo;
she asked in a tender voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t,
except for once to say that you must not make a mistake: in that
aviary he was the man.&nbsp; I know because he used to talk to me
afterwards sometimes.&nbsp; Strange!&nbsp; For six years he
seemed to carry all the world and me with it in his hand. . . .
&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He dominates you yet,&rdquo; I shouted.</p>
<p>She shook her head innocently as a child would do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no.&nbsp; You brought him into the conversation
yourself.&nbsp; You think of him much more than I
do.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her voice drooped sadly to a hopeless
note.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hardly ever do.&nbsp; He is not the sort of
person to merely flit through one&rsquo;s mind and so I have no
time.&nbsp; Look.&nbsp; I had eleven letters this morning and
there were also five telegrams before midday, which have tangled
up everything.&nbsp; I am quite frightened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she explained to me that one of them&mdash;the long one on
the top of the pile, on the table over there&mdash;seemed to
contain ugly inferences directed at herself in a menacing
way.&nbsp; She begged me to read it and see what I could make of
it.</p>
<p>I knew enough of the general situation to see at a glance that
she had misunderstood it thoroughly and even amazingly.&nbsp; I
proved it to her very quickly.&nbsp; But her mistake was so
ingenious in its wrongheadedness and arose so obviously from the
distraction of an acute mind, that I couldn&rsquo;t help looking
at her admiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rita,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you are a marvellous
idiot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I?&nbsp; Imbecile,&rdquo; she retorted with an
enchanting smile of relief.&nbsp; &ldquo;But perhaps it only
seems so to you in contrast with the lady so perfect in her
way.&nbsp; What is her way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her way, I should say, lies somewhere between her
sixtieth and seventieth year, and I have walked
t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te with her for some little distance
this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens,&rdquo; she whispered, thunderstruck.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And meantime I had the son here.&nbsp; He arrived about
five minutes after Rose left with that note for you,&rdquo; she
went on in a tone of awe.&nbsp; &ldquo;As a matter of fact, Rose
saw him across the street but she thought she had better go on to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am furious with myself for not having guessed that
much,&rdquo; I said bitterly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose you got him
out of the house about five minutes after you heard I was coming
here.&nbsp; Rose ought to have turned back when she saw him on
his way to cheer your solitude.&nbsp; That girl is stupid after
all, though she has got a certain amount of low cunning which no
doubt is very useful at times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forbid you to talk like this about Rose.&nbsp; I
won&rsquo;t have it.&nbsp; Rose is not to be abused before
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only mean to say that she failed in this instance to
read your mind, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is, without exception, the most unintelligent
thing you have said ever since I have known you.&nbsp; You may
understand a lot about running contraband and about the minds of
a certain class of people, but as to Rose&rsquo;s mind let me
tell you that in comparison with hers yours is absolutely
infantile, my adventurous friend.&nbsp; It would be contemptible
if it weren&rsquo;t so&mdash;what shall I call
it?&mdash;babyish.&nbsp; You ought to be slapped and put to
bed.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was an extraordinary earnestness in her
tone and when she ceased I listened yet to the seductive
inflexions of her voice, that no matter in what mood she spoke
seemed only fit for tenderness and love.&nbsp; And I thought
suddenly of Azzolati being ordered to take himself off from her
presence for ever, in that voice the very anger of which seemed
to twine itself gently round one&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp; No wonder
the poor wretch could not forget the scene and couldn&rsquo;t
restrain his tears on the plain of Rambouillet.&nbsp; My moods of
resentment against Rita, hot as they were, had no more duration
than a blaze of straw.&nbsp; So I only said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much <i>you</i> know about the management of
children.&rdquo;&nbsp; The corners of her lips stirred quaintly;
her animosity, especially when provoked by a personal attack upon
herself, was always tinged by a sort of wistful humour of the
most disarming kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, <i>amigo</i> George, let us leave poor Rose
alone.&nbsp; You had better tell me what you heard from the lips
of the charming old lady.&nbsp; Perfection, isn&rsquo;t
she?&nbsp; I have never seen her in my life, though she says she
has seen me several times.&nbsp; But she has written to me on
three separate occasions and every time I answered her as if I
were writing to a queen.&nbsp; <i>Amigo</i> George, how does one
write to a queen?&nbsp; How should a goatherd that could have
been mistress of a king, how should she write to an old queen
from very far away; from over the sea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will ask you as I have asked the old queen: why do
you tell me all this, Do&ntilde;a Rita?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To discover what&rsquo;s in your mind,&rdquo; she said,
a little impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t know that yet!&rdquo; I exclaimed
under my breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not in your mind.&nbsp; Can any one ever tell what
is in a man&rsquo;s mind?&nbsp; But I see you won&rsquo;t
tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good?&nbsp; You have written to her
before, I understand.&nbsp; Do you think of continuing the
correspondence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; she said in a profound tone.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She is the only woman that ever wrote to me.&nbsp; I
returned her three letters to her with my last answer, explaining
humbly that I preferred her to burn them herself.&nbsp; And I
thought that would be the end of it.&nbsp; But an occasion may
still arise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if an occasion arises,&rdquo; I said, trying to
control my rage, &ldquo;you may be able to begin your letter by
the words &lsquo;<i>Ch&egrave;re Maman</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cigarette box, which she had taken up without removing her
eyes from me, flew out of her hand and opening in mid-air
scattered cigarettes for quite a surprising distance all over the
room.&nbsp; I got up at once and wandered off picking them up
industriously.&nbsp; Do&ntilde;a Rita&rsquo;s voice behind me
said indifferently:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble, I will ring for Rose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need,&rdquo; I growled, without turning my head,
&ldquo;I can find my hat in the hall by myself, after I&rsquo;ve
finished picking up . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I returned with the box and placed it on the divan near
her.&nbsp; She sat cross-legged, leaning back on her arms, in the
blue shimmer of her embroidered robe and with the tawny halo of
her unruly hair about her face which she raised to mine with an
air of resignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;George, my friend,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we have no
manners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would never have made a career at court,
Do&ntilde;a Rita,&rdquo; I observed.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are too
impulsive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not bad manners, that&rsquo;s sheer
insolence.&nbsp; This has happened to you before.&nbsp; If it
happens again, as I can&rsquo;t be expected to wrestle with a
savage and desperate smuggler single-handed, I will go upstairs
and lock myself in my room till you leave the house.&nbsp; Why
did you say this to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, just for nothing, out of a full heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If your heart is full of things like that, then my dear
friend, you had better take it out and give it to the
crows.&nbsp; No! you said that for the pleasure of appearing
terrible.&nbsp; And you see you are not terrible at all, you are
rather amusing.&nbsp; Go on, continue to be amusing.&nbsp; Tell
me something of what you heard from the lips of that aristocratic
old lady who thinks that all men are equal and entitled to the
pursuit of happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly remember now.&nbsp; I heard something about
the unworthiness of certain white geese out of stuffy
drawing-rooms.&nbsp; It sounds mad, but the lady knows exactly
what she wants.&nbsp; I also heard your praises sung.&nbsp; I sat
there like a fool not knowing what to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&nbsp; You might have joined in the
singing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t feel in the humour, because, don&rsquo;t
you see, I had been incidentally given to understand that I was
an insignificant and superfluous person who had better get out of
the way of serious people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, <i>par exemple</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a sense, you know, it was flattering; but for the
moment it made me feel as if I had been offered a pot of mustard
to sniff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded with an amused air of understanding and I could see
that she was interested.&nbsp; &ldquo;Anything more?&rdquo; she
asked, with a flash of radiant eagerness in all her person and
bending slightly forward towards me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s hardly worth mentioning.&nbsp; It was a
sort of threat wrapped up, I believe, in genuine anxiety as to
what might happen to my youthful insignificance.&nbsp; If I
hadn&rsquo;t been rather on the alert just then I wouldn&rsquo;t
even have perceived the meaning.&nbsp; But really an allusion to
&lsquo;hot Southern blood&rsquo; I could have only one
meaning.&nbsp; Of course I laughed at it, but only &lsquo;<i>pour
l&rsquo;honneur</i>&rsquo; and to show I understood
perfectly.&nbsp; In reality it left me completely
indifferent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Rita looked very serious for a minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indifferent to the whole conversation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked at her angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the whole . . . You see I got up rather out of sorts
this morning.&nbsp; Unrefreshed, you know.&nbsp; As if tired of
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The liquid blue in her eyes remained directed at me without
any expression except that of its usual mysterious immobility,
but all her face took on a sad and thoughtful cast.&nbsp; Then as
if she had made up her mind under the pressure of necessity:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, <i>amigo</i>,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have
suffered domination and it didn&rsquo;t crush me because I have
been strong enough to live with it; I have known caprice, you may
call it folly if you like, and it left me unharmed because I was
great enough not to be captured by anything that wasn&rsquo;t
really worthy of me.&nbsp; My dear, it went down like a house of
cards before my breath.&nbsp; There is something in me that will
not be dazzled by any sort of prestige in this world, worthy or
unworthy.&nbsp; I am telling you this because you are younger
than myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want me to say that there is nothing petty or
mean about you, Do&ntilde;a Rita, then I do say it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded at me with an air of accepting the rendered justice
and went on with the utmost simplicity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is it that is coming to me now with all the
airs of virtue?&nbsp; All the lawful conventions are coming to
me, all the glamours of respectability!&nbsp; And nobody can say
that I have made as much as the slightest little sign to
them.&nbsp; Not so much as lifting my little finger.&nbsp; I
suppose you know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; I do not doubt your sincerity
in anything you say.&nbsp; I am ready to believe.&nbsp; You are
not one of those who have to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have to work&mdash;what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a phrase I have heard.&nbsp; What I meant
was that it isn&rsquo;t necessary for you to make any
signs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She seemed to meditate over this for a while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so sure of that,&rdquo; she said, with a
flash of mischief, which made her voice sound more melancholy
than before.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am not so sure myself,&rdquo; she
continued with a curious, vanishing, intonation of despair.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the truth about myself because I never
had an opportunity to compare myself to anything in the
world.&nbsp; I have been offered mock adulation, treated with
mock reserve or with mock devotion, I have been fawned upon with
an appalling earnestness of purpose, I can tell you; but these
later honours, my dear, came to me in the shape of a very loyal
and very scrupulous gentleman.&nbsp; For he is all that.&nbsp;
And as a matter of fact I was touched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know.&nbsp; Even to tears,&rdquo; I said
provokingly.&nbsp; But she wasn&rsquo;t provoked, she only shook
her head in negation (which was absurd) and pursued the trend of
her spoken thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was yesterday,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
yesterday he was extremely correct and very full of extreme
self-esteem which expressed itself in the exaggerated delicacy
with which he talked.&nbsp; But I know him in all his
moods.&nbsp; I have known him even playful.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t
listen to him.&nbsp; I was thinking of something else.&nbsp; Of
things that were neither correct nor playful and that had to be
looked at steadily with all the best that was in me.&nbsp; And
that was why, in the end&mdash;I
cried&mdash;yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw it yesterday and I had the weakness of being
moved by those tears for a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want to make me cry again I warn you you
won&rsquo;t succeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I know.&nbsp; He has been here to-day and the dry
season has set in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he has been here.&nbsp; I assure you it was
perfectly unexpected.&nbsp; Yesterday he was railing at the world
at large, at me who certainly have not made it, at himself and
even at his mother.&nbsp; All this rather in parrot language, in
the words of tradition and morality as understood by the members
of that exclusive club to which he belongs.&nbsp; And yet when I
thought that all this, those poor hackneyed words, expressed a
sincere passion I could have found in my heart to be sorry for
him.&nbsp; But he ended by telling me that one couldn&rsquo;t
believe a single word I said, or something like that.&nbsp; You
were here then, you heard it yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it cut you to the quick,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It made you depart from your dignity to the point of
weeping on any shoulder that happened to be there.&nbsp; And
considering that it was some more parrot talk after all (men have
been saying that sort of thing to women from the beginning of the
world) this sensibility seems to me childish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What perspicacity,&rdquo; she observed, with an
indulgent, mocking smile, then changed her tone.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Therefore he wasn&rsquo;t expected to-day when he turned
up, whereas you, who were expected, remained subject to the
charms of conversation in that studio.&nbsp; It never occurred to
you . . . did it?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; What had become of your
perspicacity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you I was weary of life,&rdquo; I said in a
passion.</p>
<p>She had another faint smile of a fugitive and unrelated kind
as if she had been thinking of far-off things, then roused
herself to grave animation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He came in full of smiling playfulness.&nbsp; How well
I know that mood!&nbsp; Such self-command has its beauty; but
it&rsquo;s no great help for a man with such fateful eyes.&nbsp;
I could see he was moved in his correct, restrained way, and in
his own way, too, he tried to move me with something that would
be very simple.&nbsp; He told me that ever since we became
friends, we two, he had not an hour of continuous sleep, unless
perhaps when coming back dead-tired from outpost duty, and that
he longed to get back to it and yet hadn&rsquo;t the courage to
tear himself away from here.&nbsp; He was as simple as
that.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a <i>tr&egrave;s galant homme</i> of
absolute probity, even with himself.&nbsp; I said to him: The
trouble is, Don Juan, that it isn&rsquo;t love but mistrust that
keeps you in torment.&nbsp; I might have said jealousy, but I
didn&rsquo;t like to use that word.&nbsp; A parrot would have
added that I had given him no right to be jealous.&nbsp; But I am
no parrot.&nbsp; I recognized the rights of his passion which I
could very well see.&nbsp; He is jealous.&nbsp; He is not jealous
of my past or of the future; but he is jealously mistrustful of
me, of what I am, of my very soul.&nbsp; He believes in a soul in
the same way Therese does, as something that can be touched with
grace or go to perdition; and he doesn&rsquo;t want to be damned
with me before his own judgment seat.&nbsp; He is a most noble
and loyal gentleman, but I have my own Basque peasant soul and
don&rsquo;t want to think that every time he goes away from my
feet&mdash;yes, <i>mon cher</i>, on this carpet, look for the
marks of scorching&mdash;that he goes away feeling tempted to
brush the dust off his moral sleeve.&nbsp; That!&nbsp;
Never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With brusque movements she took a cigarette out of the box,
held it in her fingers for a moment, then dropped it
unconsciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then, I don&rsquo;t love him,&rdquo; she uttered
slowly as if speaking to herself and at the same time watching
the very quality of that thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never did.&nbsp;
At first he fascinated me with his fatal aspect and his cold
society smiles.&nbsp; But I have looked into those eyes too
often.&nbsp; There are too many disdains in this aristocratic
republican without a home.&nbsp; His fate may be cruel, but it
will always be commonplace.&nbsp; While he sat there trying in a
worldly tone to explain to me the problems, the scruples, of his
suffering honour, I could see right into his heart and I was
sorry for him.&nbsp; I was sorry enough for him to feel that if
he had suddenly taken me by the throat and strangled me slowly,
<i>avec d&eacute;lices</i>, I could forgive him while I
choked.&nbsp; How correct he was!&nbsp; But bitterness against me
peeped out of every second phrase.&nbsp; At last I raised my hand
and said to him, &lsquo;Enough.&rsquo;&nbsp; I believe he was
shocked by my plebeian abruptness but he was too polite to show
it.&nbsp; His conventions will always stand in the way of his
nature.&nbsp; I told him that everything that had been said and
done during the last seven or eight months was inexplicable
unless on the assumption that he was in love with me,&mdash;and
yet in everything there was an implication that he couldn&rsquo;t
forgive me my very existence.&nbsp; I did ask him whether he
didn&rsquo;t think that it was absurd on his part . . .
&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you say that it was exquisitely
absurd?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exquisitely! . . . &rdquo; Do&ntilde;a Rita was
surprised at my question.&nbsp; &ldquo;No.&nbsp; Why should I say
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would have reconciled him to your abruptness.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s their family expression.&nbsp; It would have come with
a familiar sound and would have been less offensive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Offensive,&rdquo; Do&ntilde;a Rita repeated
earnestly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he was offended; he
suffered in another way, but I didn&rsquo;t care for that.&nbsp;
It was I that had become offended in the end, without spite, you
understand, but past bearing.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t spare
him.&nbsp; I told him plainly that to want a woman formed in mind
and body, mistress of herself, free in her choice, independent in
her thoughts; to love her apparently for what she is and at the
same time to demand from her the candour and the innocence that
could be only a shocking pretence; to know her such as life had
made her and at the same time to despise her secretly for every
touch with which her life had fashioned her&mdash;that was
neither generous nor high minded; it was positively
frantic.&nbsp; He got up and went away to lean against the
mantelpiece, there, on his elbow and with his head in his
hand.&nbsp; You have no idea of the charm and the distinction of
his pose.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t help admiring him: the
expression, the grace, the fatal suggestion of his
immobility.&nbsp; Oh, yes, I am sensible to aesthetic
impressions, I have been educated to believe that there is a soul
in them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that enigmatic, under the eyebrows glance fixed on me she
laughed her deep contralto laugh without mirth but also without
irony, and profoundly moving by the mere purity of the sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suspect he was never so disgusted and appalled in his
life.&nbsp; His self-command is the most admirable worldly thing
I have ever seen.&nbsp; What made it beautiful was that one could
feel in it a tragic suggestion as in a great work of
art.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused with an inscrutable smile that a great painter
might have put on the face of some symbolic figure for the
speculation and wonder of many generations.&nbsp; I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always thought that love for you could work great
wonders.&nbsp; And now I am certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you trying to be ironic?&rdquo; she said sadly and
very much as a child might have spoken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I answered in a tone of the
same simplicity.&nbsp; &ldquo;I find it very difficult to be
generous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, too,&rdquo; she said with a sort of funny
eagerness.&nbsp; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t treat him very
generously.&nbsp; Only I didn&rsquo;t say much more.&nbsp; I
found I didn&rsquo;t care what I said&mdash;and it would have
been like throwing insults at a beautiful composition.&nbsp; He
was well inspired not to move.&nbsp; It has spared him some
disagreeable truths and perhaps I would even have said more than
the truth.&nbsp; I am not fair.&nbsp; I am no more fair than
other people.&nbsp; I would have been harsh.&nbsp; My very
admiration was making me more angry.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s ridiculous
to say of a man got up in correct tailor clothes, but there was a
funereal grace in his attitude so that he might have been
reproduced in marble on a monument to some woman in one of those
atrocious Campo Santos: the bourgeois conception of an
aristocratic mourning lover.&nbsp; When I came to that conclusion
I became glad that I was angry or else I would have laughed right
out before him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard a woman say once, a woman of the
people&mdash;do you hear me, Do&ntilde;a Rita?&mdash;therefore
deserving your attention, that one should never laugh at
love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she said gently, &ldquo;I have been
taught to laugh at most things by a man who never laughed
himself; but it&rsquo;s true that he never spoke of love to me,
love as a subject that is.&nbsp; So perhaps . . . But
why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because (but maybe that old woman was crazy), because,
she said, there was death in the mockery of love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Rita moved slightly her beautiful shoulders and
went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad, then, I didn&rsquo;t laugh.&nbsp; And I am
also glad I said nothing more.&nbsp; I was feeling so little
generous that if I had known something then of his mother&rsquo;s
allusion to &lsquo;white geese&rsquo; I would have advised him to
get one of them and lead it away on a beautiful blue
ribbon.&nbsp; Mrs. Blunt was wrong, you know, to be so
scornful.&nbsp; A white goose is exactly what her son
wants.&nbsp; But look how badly the world is arranged.&nbsp; Such
white birds cannot be got for nothing and he has not enough money
even to buy a ribbon.&nbsp; Who knows!&nbsp; Maybe it was this
which gave that tragic quality to his pose by the mantelpiece
over there.&nbsp; Yes, that was it.&nbsp; Though no doubt I
didn&rsquo;t see it then.&nbsp; As he didn&rsquo;t offer to move
after I had done speaking I became quite unaffectedly sorry and
advised him very gently to dismiss me from his mind
definitely.&nbsp; He moved forward then and said to me in his
usual voice and with his usual smile that it would have been
excellent advice but unfortunately I was one of those women who
can&rsquo;t be dismissed at will.&nbsp; And as I shook my head he
insisted rather darkly: &lsquo;Oh, yes, Do&ntilde;a Rita, it is
so.&nbsp; Cherish no illusions about that fact.&rsquo;&nbsp; It
sounded so threatening that in my surprise I didn&rsquo;t even
acknowledge his parting bow.&nbsp; He went out of that false
situation like a wounded man retreating after a fight.&nbsp; No,
I have nothing to reproach myself with.&nbsp; I did
nothing.&nbsp; I led him into nothing.&nbsp; Whatever illusions
have passed through my head I kept my distance, and he was so
loyal to what he seemed to think the redeeming proprieties of the
situation that he has gone from me for good without so much as
kissing the tips of my fingers.&nbsp; He must have felt like a
man who had betrayed himself for nothing.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
horrible.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the fault of that enormous fortune of
mine, and I wish with all my heart that I could give it to him;
for he couldn&rsquo;t help his hatred of the thing that is: and
as to his love, which is just as real, well&mdash;could I have
rushed away from him to shut myself up in a convent?&nbsp; Could
I?&nbsp; After all I have a right to my share of
daylight.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>
<p>I took my eyes from her face and became aware that dusk was
beginning to steal into the room.&nbsp; How strange it
seemed.&nbsp; Except for the glazed rotunda part its long walls,
divided into narrow panels separated by an order of flat
pilasters, presented, depicted on a black background and in vivid
colours, slender women with butterfly wings and lean youths with
narrow birds&rsquo; wings.&nbsp; The effect was supposed to be
Pompeiian and Rita and I had often laughed at the delirious fancy
of some enriched shopkeeper.&nbsp; But still it was a display of
fancy, a sign of grace; but at that moment these figures appeared
to me weird and intrusive and strangely alive in their attenuated
grace of unearthly beings concealing a power to see and hear.</p>
<p>Without words, without gestures, Do&ntilde;a Rita was heard
again.&nbsp; &ldquo;It may have been as near coming to pass as
this.&rdquo;&nbsp; She showed me the breadth of her little finger
nail.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, as near as that.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp;
How?&nbsp; Just like that, for nothing.&nbsp; Because it had come
up.&nbsp; Because a wild notion had entered a practical old
woman&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; And the best of it is that I
have nothing to complain of.&nbsp; Had I surrendered I would have
been perfectly safe with these two.&nbsp; It is they or rather he
who couldn&rsquo;t trust me, or rather that something which I
express, which I stand for.&nbsp; Mills would never tell me what
it was.&nbsp; Perhaps he didn&rsquo;t know exactly himself.&nbsp;
He said it was something like genius.&nbsp; My genius!&nbsp; Oh,
I am not conscious of it, believe me, I am not conscious of
it.&nbsp; But if I were I wouldn&rsquo;t pluck it out and cast it
away.&nbsp; I am ashamed of nothing, of nothing!&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t be stupid enough to think that I have the slightest
regret.&nbsp; There is no regret.&nbsp; First of all because I am
I&mdash;and then because . . . My dear, believe me, I have had a
horrible time of it myself lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This seemed to be the last word.&nbsp; Outwardly quiet, all
the time, it was only then that she became composed enough to
light an enormous cigarette of the same pattern as those made
specially for the king&mdash;<i>por el Rey</i>! After a time,
tipping the ash into the bowl on her left hand, she asked me in a
friendly, almost tender, tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you thinking of, <i>amigo</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking of your immense generosity.&nbsp; You
want to give a crown to one man, a fortune to another.&nbsp; That
is very fine.&nbsp; But I suppose there is a limit to your
generosity somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why there should be any
limit&mdash;to fine intentions!&nbsp; Yes, one would like to pay
ransom and be done with it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the feeling of a captive; and yet somehow
I can&rsquo;t think of you as ever having been anybody&rsquo;s
captive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do display some wonderful insight sometimes.&nbsp;
My dear, I begin to suspect that men are rather conceited about
their powers.&nbsp; They think they dominate us.&nbsp; Even
exceptional men will think that; men too great for mere vanity,
men like Henry All&egrave;gre for instance, who by his consistent
and serene detachment was certainly fit to dominate all sorts of
people.&nbsp; Yet for the most part they can only do it because
women choose more or less consciously to let them do so.&nbsp;
Henry All&egrave;gre, if any man, might have been certain of his
own power; and yet, look: I was a chit of a girl, I was sitting
with a book where I had no business to be, in his own garden,
when he suddenly came upon me, an ignorant girl of seventeen, a
most uninviting creature with a tousled head, in an old black
frock and shabby boots.&nbsp; I could have run away.&nbsp; I was
perfectly capable of it.&nbsp; But I stayed looking up at him
and&mdash;in the end it was <span class="smcap">he</span> who
went away and it was I who stayed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consciously?&rdquo; I murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consciously?&nbsp; You may just as well ask my shadow
that lay so still by me on the young grass in that morning
sunshine.&nbsp; I never knew before how still I could keep.&nbsp;
It wasn&rsquo;t the stillness of terror.&nbsp; I remained,
knowing perfectly well that if I ran he was not the man to run
after me.&nbsp; I remember perfectly his deep-toned, politely
indifferent &lsquo;<i>Restez donc</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; He was
mistaken.&nbsp; Already then I hadn&rsquo;t the slightest
intention to move.&nbsp; And if you ask me again how far
conscious all this was the nearest answer I can make you is this:
that I remained on purpose, but I didn&rsquo;t know for what
purpose I remained.&nbsp; Really, that couldn&rsquo;t be
expected. . . . Why do you sigh like this?&nbsp; Would you have
preferred me to be idiotically innocent or abominably
wise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are not the questions that trouble me,&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I sighed it is because I am
weary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And getting stiff, too, I should say, in this Pompeiian
armchair.&nbsp; You had better get out of it and sit on this
couch as you always used to do.&nbsp; That, at any rate, is not
Pompeiian.&nbsp; You have been growing of late extremely formal,
I don&rsquo;t know why.&nbsp; If it is a pose then for
goodness&rsquo; sake drop it.&nbsp; Are you going to model
yourself on Captain Blunt?&nbsp; You couldn&rsquo;t, you
know.&nbsp; You are too young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to model myself on anybody,&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;And anyway Blunt is too romantic; and,
moreover, he has been and is yet in love with you&mdash;a thing
that requires some style, an attitude, something of which I am
altogether incapable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know it isn&rsquo;t so stupid, this what you have
just said.&nbsp; Yes, there is something in this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not stupid,&rdquo; I protested, without much
heat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you are.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know the world
enough to judge.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know how wise men can
be.&nbsp; Owls are nothing to them.&nbsp; Why do you try to look
like an owl?&nbsp; There are thousands and thousands of them
waiting for me outside the door: the staring, hissing
beasts.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know what a relief of mental ease
and intimacy you have been to me in the frankness of gestures and
speeches and thoughts, sane or insane, that we have been throwing
at each other.&nbsp; I have known nothing of this in my life but
with you.&nbsp; There had always been some fear, some constraint,
lurking in the background behind everybody,
everybody&mdash;except you, my friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An unmannerly, Arcadian state of affairs.&nbsp; I am
glad you like it.&nbsp; Perhaps it&rsquo;s because you were
intelligent enough to perceive that I was not in love with you in
any sort of style.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you were always your own self, unwise and reckless
and with something in it kindred to mine, if I may say so without
offence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may say anything without offence.&nbsp; But has it
never occurred to your sagacity that I just, simply, loved
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just&mdash;simply,&rdquo; she repeated in a wistful
tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t want to trouble your head about it, is
that it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor head.&nbsp; From your tone one might think you
yearned to cut it off.&nbsp; No, my dear, I have made up my mind
not to lose my head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would be astonished to know how little I care for
your mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would I?&nbsp; Come and sit on the couch all the
same,&rdquo; she said after a moment of hesitation.&nbsp; Then,
as I did not move at once, she added with indifference:
&ldquo;You may sit as far away as you like, it&rsquo;s big
enough, goodness knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The light was ebbing slowly out of the rotunda and to my
bodily eyes she was beginning to grow shadowy.&nbsp; I sat down
on the couch and for a long time no word passed between us.&nbsp;
We made no movement.&nbsp; We did not even turn towards each
other.&nbsp; All I was conscious of was the softness of the seat
which seemed somehow to cause a relaxation of my stern mood, I
won&rsquo;t say against my will but without any will on my
part.&nbsp; Another thing I was conscious of, strangely enough,
was the enormous brass bowl for cigarette ends.&nbsp; Quietly,
with the least possible action, Do&ntilde;a Rita moved it to the
other side of her motionless person.&nbsp; Slowly, the fantastic
women with butterflies&rsquo; wings and the slender-limbed youths
with the gorgeous pinions on their shoulders were vanishing into
their black backgrounds with an effect of silent discretion,
leaving us to ourselves.</p>
<p>I felt suddenly extremely exhausted, absolutely overcome with
fatigue since I had moved; as if to sit on that Pompeiian chair
had been a task almost beyond human strength, a sort of labour
that must end in collapse.&nbsp; I fought against it for a moment
and then my resistance gave way.&nbsp; Not all at once but as if
yielding to an irresistible pressure (for I was not conscious of
any irresistible attraction) I found myself with my head resting,
with a weight I felt must be crushing, on Do&ntilde;a
Rita&rsquo;s shoulder which yet did not give way, did not flinch
at all.&nbsp; A faint scent of violets filled the tragic
emptiness of my head and it seemed impossible to me that I should
not cry from sheer weakness.&nbsp; But I remained dry-eyed.&nbsp;
I only felt myself slipping lower and lower and I caught her
round the waist clinging to her not from any intention but purely
by instinct.&nbsp; All that time she hadn&rsquo;t stirred.&nbsp;
There was only the slight movement of her breathing that showed
her to be alive; and with closed eyes I imagined her to be lost
in thought, removed by an incredible meditation while I clung to
her, to an immense distance from the earth.&nbsp; The distance
must have been immense because the silence was so perfect, the
feeling as if of eternal stillness.&nbsp; I had a distinct
impression of being in contact with an infinity that had the
slightest possible rise and fall, was pervaded by a warm,
delicate scent of violets and through which came a hand from
somewhere to rest lightly on my head.&nbsp; Presently my ear
caught the faint and regular pulsation of her heart, firm and
quick, infinitely touching in its persistent mystery, disclosing
itself into my very ear&mdash;and my felicity became
complete.</p>
<p>It was a dreamlike state combined with a dreamlike sense of
insecurity.&nbsp; Then in that warm and scented infinity, or
eternity, in which I rested lost in bliss but ready for any
catastrophe, I heard the distant, hardly audible, and fit to
strike terror into the heart, ringing of a bell.&nbsp; At this
sound the greatness of spaces departed.&nbsp; I felt the world
close about me; the world of darkened walls, of very deep grey
dusk against the panes, and I asked in a pained voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you ring, Rita?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a bell rope within reach of her hand.&nbsp; I had
not felt her move, but she said very low:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rang for the lights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t want the lights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was time,&rdquo; she whispered secretly.</p>
<p>Somewhere within the house a door slammed.&nbsp; I got away
from her feeling small and weak as if the best part of me had
been torn away and irretrievably lost.&nbsp; Rose must have been
somewhere near the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s abominable,&rdquo; I murmured to the still,
idol-like shadow on the couch.</p>
<p>The answer was a hurried, nervous whisper: &ldquo;I tell you
it was time.&nbsp; I rang because I had no strength to push you
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I suffered a moment of giddiness before the door opened, light
streamed in, and Rose entered, preceding a man in a green baize
apron whom I had never seen, carrying on an enormous tray three
Argand lamps fitted into vases of Pompeiian form.&nbsp; Rose
distributed them over the room.&nbsp; In the flood of soft light
the winged youths and the butterfly women reappeared on the
panels, affected, gorgeous, callously unconscious of anything
having happened during their absence.&nbsp; Rose attended to the
lamp on the nearest mantelpiece, then turned about and asked in a
confident undertone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Monsieur d&icirc;ne</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had lost myself with my elbows on my knees and my head in my
hands, but I heard the words distinctly.&nbsp; I heard also the
silence which ensued.&nbsp; I sat up and took the responsibility
of the answer on myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible.&nbsp; I am going to sea this
evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was perfectly true only I had totally forgotten it till
then.&nbsp; For the last two days my being was no longer composed
of memories but exclusively of sensations of the most absorbing,
disturbing, exhausting nature.&nbsp; I was like a man who has
been buffeted by the sea or by a mob till he loses all hold on
the world in the misery of his helplessness.&nbsp; But now I was
recovering.&nbsp; And naturally the first thing I remembered was
the fact that I was going to sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have heard, Rose,&rdquo; Do&ntilde;a Rita said at
last with some impatience.</p>
<p>The girl waited a moment longer before she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&nbsp; There is a man waiting for Monsieur in
the hall.&nbsp; A seaman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It could be no one but Dominic.&nbsp; It dawned upon me that
since the evening of our return I had not been near him or the
ship, which was completely unusual, unheard of, and well
calculated to startle Dominic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen him before,&rdquo; continued Rose,
&ldquo;and as he told me he has been pursuing Monsieur all the
afternoon and didn&rsquo;t like to go away without seeing
Monsieur for a moment, I proposed to him to wait in the hall till
Monsieur was at liberty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said: &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; and with a sudden resumption
of her extremely busy, not-a-moment-to-lose manner Rose departed
from the room.&nbsp; I lingered in an imaginary world full of
tender light, of unheard-of colours, with a mad riot of flowers
and an inconceivable happiness under the sky arched above its
yawning precipices, while a feeling of awe enveloped me like its
own proper atmosphere.&nbsp; But everything vanished at the sound
of Do&ntilde;a Rita&rsquo;s loud whisper full of boundless
dismay, such as to make one&rsquo;s hair stir on one&rsquo;s
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu</i>!&nbsp; And what is going to happen
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She got down from the couch and walked to a window.&nbsp; When
the lights had been brought into the room all the panes had
turned inky black; for the night had come and the garden was full
of tall bushes and trees screening off the gas lamps of the main
alley of the Prado.&nbsp; Whatever the question meant she was not
likely to see an answer to it outside.&nbsp; But her whisper had
offended me, had hurt something infinitely deep, infinitely
subtle and infinitely clear-eyed in my nature.&nbsp; I said after
her from the couch on which I had remained, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
lose your composure.&nbsp; You will always have some sort of bell
at hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I saw her shrug her uncovered shoulders impatiently.&nbsp; Her
forehead was against the very blackness of the panes; pulled
upward from the beautiful, strong nape of her neck, the twisted
mass of her tawny hair was held high upon her head by the arrow
of gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You set up for being unforgiving,&rdquo; she said
without anger.</p>
<p>I sprang to my feet while she turned about and came towards me
bravely, with a wistful smile on her bold, adolescent face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; she went on in a voice like a
wave of love itself, &ldquo;that one should try to understand
before one sets up for being unforgiving.&nbsp; Forgiveness is a
very fine word.&nbsp; It is a fine invocation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are other fine words in the language such as
fascination, fidelity, also frivolity; and as for invocations
there are plenty of them, too; for instance: alas, heaven help
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We stood very close together, her narrow eyes were as
enigmatic as ever, but that face, which, like some ideal
conception of art, was incapable of anything like untruth and
grimace, expressed by some mysterious means such a depth of
infinite patience that I felt profoundly ashamed of myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This thing is beyond words altogether,&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Beyond forgiveness, beyond forgetting, beyond
anger or jealousy. . . . There is nothing between us two that
could make us act together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we must fall back perhaps on something within us,
that&mdash;you admit it?&mdash;we have in common.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be childish,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You give one with a perpetual and intense freshness
feelings and sensations that are as old as the world itself, and
you imagine that your enchantment can be broken off anywhere, at
any time!&nbsp; But it can&rsquo;t be broken.&nbsp; And
forgetfulness, like everything else, can only come from
you.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s an impossible situation to stand up
against.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She listened with slightly parted lips as if to catch some
further resonances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a sort of generous ardour about you,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;which I don&rsquo;t really understand.&nbsp; No,
I don&rsquo;t know it.&nbsp; Believe me, it is not of myself I am
thinking.&nbsp; And you&mdash;you are going out to-night to make
another landing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is a fact that before many hours I will be
sailing away from you to try my luck once more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your wonderful luck,&rdquo; she breathed out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I am wonderfully lucky.&nbsp; Unless the luck
really is yours&mdash;in having found somebody like me, who cares
at the same time so much and so little for what you have at
heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time will you be leaving the harbour?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some time between midnight and daybreak.&nbsp; Our men
may be a little late in joining, but certainly we will be gone
before the first streak of light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What freedom!&rdquo; she murmured enviously.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something I shall never know. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Freedom!&rdquo; I protested.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am a slave
to my word.&nbsp; There will be a siring of carts and mules on a
certain part of the coast, and a most ruffianly lot of men, men
you understand, men with wives and children and sweethearts, who
from the very moment they start on a trip risk a bullet in the
head at any moment, but who have a perfect conviction that I will
never fail them.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s my freedom.&nbsp; I wonder
what they would think if they knew of your existence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t exist,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy to say.&nbsp; But I will go as if you
didn&rsquo;t exist&mdash;yet only because you do exist.&nbsp; You
exist in me.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know where I end and you
begin.&nbsp; You have got into my heart and into my veins and
into my brain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take this fancy out and trample it down in the
dust,&rdquo; she said in a tone of timid entreaty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heroically,&rdquo; I suggested with the sarcasm of
despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, heroically,&rdquo; she said; and there
passed between us dim smiles, I have no doubt of the most
touching imbecility on earth.&nbsp; We were standing by then in
the middle of the room with its vivid colours on a black
background, with its multitude of winged figures with pale limbs,
with hair like halos or flames, all strangely tense in their
strained, decorative attitudes.&nbsp; Do&ntilde;a Rita made a
step towards me, and as I attempted to seize her hand she flung
her arms round my neck.&nbsp; I felt their strength drawing me
towards her and by a sort of blind and desperate effort I
resisted.&nbsp; And all the time she was repeating with nervous
insistence:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is true that you will go.&nbsp; You will
surely.&nbsp; Not because of those people but because of
me.&nbsp; You will go away because you feel you must.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With every word urging me to get away, her clasp tightened,
she hugged my head closer to her breast.&nbsp; I submitted,
knowing well that I could free myself by one more effort which it
was in my power to make.&nbsp; But before I made it, in a sort of
desperation, I pressed a long kiss into the hollow of her
throat.&nbsp; And lo&mdash;there was no need for any
effort.&nbsp; With a stifled cry of surprise her arms fell off me
as if she had been shot.&nbsp; I must have been giddy, and
perhaps we both were giddy, but the next thing I knew there was a
good foot of space between us in the peaceful glow of the
ground-glass globes, in the everlasting stillness of the winged
figures.&nbsp; Something in the quality of her exclamation,
something utterly unexpected, something I had never heard before,
and also the way she was looking at me with a sort of
incredulous, concentrated attention, disconcerted me
exceedingly.&nbsp; I knew perfectly well what I had done and yet
I felt that I didn&rsquo;t understand what had happened.&nbsp; I
became suddenly abashed and I muttered that I had better go and
dismiss that poor Dominic.&nbsp; She made no answer, gave no
sign.&nbsp; She stood there lost in a vision&mdash;or was it a
sensation?&mdash;of the most absorbing kind.&nbsp; I hurried out
into the hall, shamefaced, as if I were making my escape while
she wasn&rsquo;t looking.&nbsp; And yet I felt her looking
fixedly at me, with a sort of stupefaction on her
features&mdash;in her whole attitude&mdash;as though she had
never even heard of such a thing as a kiss in her life.</p>
<p>A dim lamp (of Pompeiian form) hanging on a long chain left
the hall practically dark.&nbsp; Dominic, advancing towards me
from a distant corner, was but a little more opaque shadow than
the others.&nbsp; He had expected me on board every moment till
about three o&rsquo;clock, but as I didn&rsquo;t turn up and gave
no sign of life in any other way he started on his hunt.&nbsp; He
sought news of me from the <i>gar&ccedil;ons</i> at the various
caf&eacute;s, from the <i>cochers de fiacre</i> in front of the
Exchange, from the tobacconist lady at the counter of the
fashionable <i>D&eacute;bit de Tabac</i>, from the old man who
sold papers outside the <i>cercle</i>, and from the flower-girl
at the door of the fashionable restaurant where I had my
table.&nbsp; That young woman, whose business name was Irma, had
come on duty about mid-day.&nbsp; She said to Dominic: &ldquo;I
think I&rsquo;ve seen all his friends this morning but I
haven&rsquo;t seen him for a week.&nbsp; What has become of
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what I want to know,&rdquo;
Dominic replied in a fury and then went back to the harbour on
the chance that I might have called either on board or at Madame
L&eacute;onore&rsquo;s caf&eacute;.</p>
<p>I expressed to him my surprise that he should fuss about me
like an old hen over a chick.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t like him at
all.&nbsp; And he said that &ldquo;<i>en effet</i>&rdquo; it was
Madame L&eacute;onore who wouldn&rsquo;t give him any
peace.&nbsp; He hoped I wouldn&rsquo;t mind, it was best to
humour women in little things; and so he started off again, made
straight for the street of the Consuls, was told there that I
wasn&rsquo;t at home but the woman of the house looked so funny
that he didn&rsquo;t know what to make of it.&nbsp; Therefore,
after some hesitation, he took the liberty to inquire at this
house, too, and being told that I couldn&rsquo;t be disturbed,
had made up his mind not to go on board without actually setting
his eyes on me and hearing from my own lips that nothing was
changed as to sailing orders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing changed, Dominic,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No change of any sort?&rdquo; he insisted, looking very
sombre and speaking gloomily from under his black moustaches in
the dim glow of the alabaster lamp hanging above his head.&nbsp;
He peered at me in an extraordinary manner as if he wanted to
make sure that I had all my limbs about me.&nbsp; I asked him to
call for my bag at the other house, on his way to the harbour,
and he departed reassured, not, however, without remarking
ironically that ever since she saw that American cavalier Madame
L&eacute;onore was not easy in her mind about me.</p>
<p>As I stood alone in the hall, without a sound of any sort,
Rose appeared before me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur will dine after all,&rdquo; she whispered
calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My good girl, I am going to sea to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What am I going to do with Madame?&rdquo; she murmured
to herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;She will insist on returning to
Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, have you heard of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never get more than two hours&rsquo; notice,&rdquo;
she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I know how it will be,&rdquo; her
voice lost its calmness.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can look after Madame up
to a certain point but I cannot be altogether responsible.&nbsp;
There is a dangerous person who is everlastingly trying to see
Madame alone.&nbsp; I have managed to keep him off several times
but there is a beastly old journalist who is encouraging him in
his attempts, and I daren&rsquo;t even speak to Madame about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of person do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, a man,&rdquo; she said scornfully.</p>
<p>I snatched up my coat and hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t there dozens of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; But this one is dangerous.&nbsp; Madame must
have given him a hold on her in some way.&nbsp; I ought not to
talk like this about Madame and I wouldn&rsquo;t to anybody but
Monsieur.&nbsp; I am always on the watch, but what is a poor girl
to do? . . . Isn&rsquo;t Monsieur going back to
Madame?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I am not going back.&nbsp; Not this
time.&rdquo;&nbsp; A mist seemed to fall before my eyes.&nbsp; I
could hardly see the girl standing by the closed door of the
Pempeiian room with extended hand, as if turned to stone.&nbsp;
But my voice was firm enough.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not this time,&rdquo;
I repeated, and became aware of the great noise of the wind
amongst the trees, with the lashing of a rain squall against the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps some other time,&rdquo; I added.</p>
<p>I heard her say twice to herself: &ldquo;<i>Mon
Dieu</i>!&nbsp; <i>Mon</i>, <i>Dieu</i>!&rdquo; and then a
dismayed: &ldquo;What can Monsieur expect me to do?&rdquo;&nbsp;
But I had to appear insensible to her distress and that not
altogether because, in fact, I had no option but to go
away.&nbsp; I remember also a distinct wilfulness in my attitude
and something half-contemptuous in my words as I laid my hand on
the knob of the front door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will tell Madame that I am gone.&nbsp; It will
please her.&nbsp; Tell her that I am
gone&mdash;heroically.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose had come up close to me.&nbsp; She met my words by a
despairing outward movement of her hands as though she were
giving everything up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see it clearly now that Madame has no friends,&rdquo;
she declared with such a force of restrained bitterness that it
nearly made me pause.&nbsp; But the very obscurity of actuating
motives drove me on and I stepped out through the doorway
muttering: &ldquo;Everything is as Madame wishes it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shot at me a swift: &ldquo;You should resist,&rdquo; of an
extraordinary intensity, but I strode on down the path.&nbsp;
Then Rose&rsquo;s schooled temper gave way at last and I heard
her angry voice screaming after me furiously through the wind and
rain: &ldquo;No!&nbsp; Madame has no friends.&nbsp; Not
one!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>PART FIVE</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
<p>That night I didn&rsquo;t get on board till just before
midnight and Dominic could not conceal his relief at having me
safely there.&nbsp; Why he should have been so uneasy it was
impossible to say but at the time I had a sort of impression that
my inner destruction (it was nothing less) had affected my
appearance, that my doom was as it were written on my face.&nbsp;
I was a mere receptacle for dust and ashes, a living testimony to
the vanity of all things.&nbsp; My very thoughts were like a
ghostly rustle of dead leaves.&nbsp; But we had an extremely
successful trip, and for most of the time Dominic displayed an
unwonted jocularity of a dry and biting kind with which, he
maintained, he had been infected by no other person than
myself.&nbsp; As, with all his force of character, he was very
responsive to the moods of those he liked I have no doubt he
spoke the truth.&nbsp; But I know nothing about it.&nbsp; The
observer, more or less alert, whom each of us carries in his own
consciousness, failed me altogether, had turned away his face in
sheer horror, or else had fainted from the strain.&nbsp; And thus
I had to live alone, unobserved even by myself.</p>
<p>But the trip had been successful.&nbsp; We re-entered the
harbour very quietly as usual and when our craft had been moored
unostentatiously amongst the plebeian stone-carriers, Dominic,
whose grim joviality had subsided in the last twenty-four hours
of our homeward run, abandoned me to myself as though indeed I
had been a doomed man.&nbsp; He only stuck his head for a moment
into our little cuddy where I was changing my clothes and being
told in answer to his question that I had no special orders to
give went ashore without waiting for me.</p>
<p>Generally we used to step on the quay together and I never
failed to enter for a moment Madame L&eacute;onore&rsquo;s
caf&eacute;.&nbsp; But this time when I got on the quay Dominic
was nowhere to be seen.&nbsp; What was it?&nbsp;
Abandonment&mdash;discretion&mdash;or had he quarrelled with his
L&eacute;onore before leaving on the trip?</p>
<p>My way led me past the caf&eacute; and through the glass panes
I saw that he was already there.&nbsp; On the other side of the
little marble table Madame L&eacute;onore, leaning with mature
grace on her elbow, was listening to him absorbed.&nbsp; Then I
passed on and&mdash;what would you have!&mdash;I ended by making
my way into the street of the Consuls.&nbsp; I had nowhere else
to go.&nbsp; There were my things in the apartment on the first
floor.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t bear the thought of meeting anybody
I knew.</p>
<p>The feeble gas flame in the hall was still there, on duty, as
though it had never been turned off since I last crossed the hall
at half-past eleven in the evening to go to the harbour.&nbsp;
The small flame had watched me letting myself out; and now,
exactly of the same size, the poor little tongue of light (there
was something wrong with that burner) watched me letting myself
in, as indeed it had done many times before.&nbsp; Generally the
impression was that of entering an untenanted house, but this
time before I could reach the foot of the stairs Therese glided
out of the passage leading into the studio.&nbsp; After the usual
exclamations she assured me that everything was ready for me
upstairs, had been for days, and offered to get me something to
eat at once.&nbsp; I accepted and said I would be down in the
studio in half an hour.&nbsp; I found her there by the side of
the laid table ready for conversation.&nbsp; She began by telling
me&mdash;the dear, poor young Monsieur&mdash;in a sort of
plaintive chant, that there were no letters for me, no letters of
any kind, no letters from anybody.&nbsp; Glances of absolutely
terrifying tenderness mingled with flashes of cunning swept over
me from head to foot while I tried to eat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you giving me Captain Blunt&rsquo;s wine to
drink?&rdquo; I asked, noting the straw-coloured liquid in my
glass.</p>
<p>She screwed up her mouth as if she had a twinge of toothache
and assured me that the wine belonged to the house.&nbsp; I would
have to pay her for it.&nbsp; As far as personal feelings go,
Blunt, who addressed her always with polite seriousness, was not
a favourite with her.&nbsp; The &ldquo;charming, brave
Monsieur&rdquo; was now fighting for the King and religion
against the impious Liberals.&nbsp; He went away the very morning
after I had left and, oh! she remembered, he had asked her before
going away whether I was still in the house.&nbsp; Wanted
probably to say good-bye to me, shake my hand, the dear, polite
Monsieur.</p>
<p>I let her run on in dread expectation of what she would say
next but she stuck to the subject of Blunt for some time
longer.&nbsp; He had written to her once about some of his things
which he wanted her to send to Paris to his mother&rsquo;s
address; but she was going to do nothing of the kind.&nbsp; She
announced this with a pious smile; and in answer to my questions
I discovered that it was a stratagem to make Captain Blunt return
to the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will get yourself into trouble with the police,
Mademoiselle Therese, if you go on like that,&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; But she was as obstinate as a mule and assured me
with the utmost confidence that many people would be ready to
defend a poor honest girl.&nbsp; There was something behind this
attitude which I could not fathom.&nbsp; Suddenly she fetched a
deep sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our Rita, too, will end by coming to her
sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The name for which I had been waiting deprived me of speech
for the moment.&nbsp; The poor mad sinner had rushed off to some
of her wickednesses in Paris.&nbsp; Did I know?&nbsp; No?&nbsp;
How could she tell whether I did know or not?&nbsp; Well!&nbsp; I
had hardly left the house, so to speak, when Rita was down with
her maid behaving as if the house did really still belong to her.
. .</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time was it?&rdquo; I managed to ask.&nbsp; And
with the words my life itself was being forced out through my
lips.&nbsp; But Therese, not noticing anything strange about me,
said it was something like half-past seven in the morning.&nbsp;
The &ldquo;poor sinner&rdquo; was all in black as if she were
going to church (except for her expression, which was enough to
shock any honest person), and after ordering her with frightful
menaces not to let anybody know she was in the house she rushed
upstairs and locked herself up in my bedroom, while &ldquo;that
French creature&rdquo; (whom she seemed to love more than her own
sister) went into my salon and hid herself behind the window
curtain.</p>
<p>I had recovered sufficiently to ask in a quiet natural voice
whether Do&ntilde;a Rita and Captain Blunt had seen each
other.&nbsp; Apparently they had not seen each other.&nbsp; The
polite captain had looked so stern while packing up his kit that
Therese dared not speak to him at all.&nbsp; And he was in a
hurry, too.&nbsp; He had to see his dear mother off to Paris
before his own departure.&nbsp; Very stern.&nbsp; But he shook
her hand with a very nice bow.</p>
<p>Therese elevated her right hand for me to see.&nbsp; It was
broad and short with blunt fingers, as usual.&nbsp; The pressure
of Captain Blunt&rsquo;s handshake had not altered its unlovely
shape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the good of telling him that our Rita was
here?&rdquo; went on Therese.&nbsp; &ldquo;I would have been
ashamed of her coming here and behaving as if the house belonged
to her!&nbsp; I had already said some prayers at his intention at
the half-past six mass, the brave gentleman.&nbsp; That maid of
my sister Rita was upstairs watching him drive away with her evil
eyes, but I made a sign of the cross after the fiacre, and then I
went upstairs and banged at your door, my dear kind young
Monsieur, and shouted to Rita that she had no right to lock
herself in any of my <i>locataires</i>&rsquo; rooms.&nbsp; At
last she opened it&mdash;and what do you think?&nbsp; All her
hair was loose over her shoulders.&nbsp; I suppose it all came
down when she flung her hat on your bed.&nbsp; I noticed when she
arrived that her hair wasn&rsquo;t done properly.&nbsp; She used
your brushes to do it up again in front of your glass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a moment,&rdquo; I said, and jumped up, upsetting
my wine to run upstairs as fast as I could.&nbsp; I lighted the
gas, all the three jets in the middle of the room, the jet by the
bedside and two others flanking the dressing-table.&nbsp; I had
been struck by the wild hope of finding a trace of Rita&rsquo;s
passage, a sign or something.&nbsp; I pulled out all the drawers
violently, thinking that perhaps she had hidden there a scrap of
paper, a note.&nbsp; It was perfectly mad.&nbsp; Of course there
was no chance of that.&nbsp; Therese would have seen to it.&nbsp;
I picked up one after another all the various objects on the
dressing-table.&nbsp; On laying my hands on the brushes I had a
profound emotion, and with misty eyes I examined them
meticulously with the new hope of finding one of Rita&rsquo;s
tawny hairs entangled amongst the bristles by a miraculous
chance.&nbsp; But Therese would have done away with that chance,
too.&nbsp; There was nothing to be seen, though I held them up to
the light with a beating heart.&nbsp; It was written that not
even that trace of her passage on the earth should remain with
me; not to help but, as it were, to soothe the memory.&nbsp; Then
I lighted a cigarette and came downstairs slowly.&nbsp; My
unhappiness became dulled, as the grief of those who mourn for
the dead gets dulled in the overwhelming sensation that
everything is over, that a part of themselves is lost beyond
recall taking with it all the savour of life.</p>
<p>I discovered Therese still on the very same spot of the floor,
her hands folded over each other and facing my empty chair before
which the spilled wine had soaked a large portion of the
table-cloth.&nbsp; She hadn&rsquo;t moved at all.&nbsp; She
hadn&rsquo;t even picked up the overturned glass.&nbsp; But
directly I appeared she began to speak in an ingratiating
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you have missed anything of yours upstairs, my dear
young Monsieur, you mustn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s me.&nbsp; You
don&rsquo;t know what our Rita is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to goodness,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that she had
taken something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And again I became inordinately agitated as though it were my
absolute fate to be everlastingly dying and reviving to the
tormenting fact of her existence.&nbsp; Perhaps she had taken
something?&nbsp; Anything.&nbsp; Some small object.&nbsp; I
thought suddenly of a Rhenish-stone match-box.&nbsp; Perhaps it
was that.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t remember having seen it when
upstairs.&nbsp; I wanted to make sure at once.&nbsp; At
once.&nbsp; But I commanded myself to sit still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she so wealthy,&rdquo; Therese went on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Even you with your dear generous little heart can do
nothing for our Rita.&nbsp; No man can do anything for
her&mdash;except perhaps one, but she is so evilly disposed
towards him that she wouldn&rsquo;t even see him, if in the
goodness of his forgiving heart he were to offer his hand to
her.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s her bad conscience that frightens
her.&nbsp; He loves her more than his life, the dear, charitable
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean some rascal in Paris that I believe persecutes
Do&ntilde;a Rita.&nbsp; Listen, Mademoiselle Therese, if you know
where he hangs out you had better let him have word to be
careful.&nbsp; I believe he, too, is mixed up in the Carlist
intrigue.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you know that your sister can get him
shut up any day or get him expelled by the police?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Therese sighed deeply and put on a look of pained virtue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the hardness of her heart.&nbsp; She tried to be
tender with me.&nbsp; She is awful.&nbsp; I said to her,
&lsquo;Rita, have you sold your soul to the Devil?&rsquo; and she
shouted like a fiend: &lsquo;For happiness!&nbsp; Ha, ha,
ha!&rsquo;&nbsp; She threw herself backwards on that couch in
your room and laughed and laughed and laughed as if I had been
tickling her, and she drummed on the floor with the heels of her
shoes.&nbsp; She is possessed.&nbsp; Oh, my dear innocent young
Monsieur, you have never seen anything like that.&nbsp; That
wicked girl who serves her rushed in with a tiny glass bottle and
put it to her nose; but I had a mind to run out and fetch the
priest from the church where I go to early mass.&nbsp; Such a
nice, stout, severe man.&nbsp; But that false, cheating creature
(I am sure she is robbing our Rita from morning to night), she
talked to our Rita very low and quieted her down.&nbsp; I am sure
I don&rsquo;t know what she said.&nbsp; She must be leagued with
the devil.&nbsp; And then she asked me if I would go down and
make a cup of chocolate for her Madame.&nbsp;
Madame&mdash;that&rsquo;s our Rita.&nbsp; Madame!&nbsp; It seems
they were going off directly to Paris and her Madame had had
nothing to eat since the morning of the day before.&nbsp; Fancy
me being ordered to make chocolate for our Rita!&nbsp; However,
the poor thing looked so exhausted and white-faced that I
went.&nbsp; Ah! the devil can give you an awful shake up if he
likes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Therese fetched another deep sigh and raising her eyes looked
at me with great attention.&nbsp; I preserved an inscrutable
expression, for I wanted to hear all she had to tell me of
Rita.&nbsp; I watched her with the greatest anxiety composing her
face into a cheerful expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Do&ntilde;a Rita is gone to Paris?&rdquo; I asked
negligently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear Monsieur.&nbsp; I believe she went
straight to the railway station from here.&nbsp; When she first
got up from the couch she could hardly stand.&nbsp; But before,
while she was drinking the chocolate which I made for her, I
tried to get her to sign a paper giving over the house to me, but
she only closed her eyes and begged me to try and be a good
sister and leave her alone for half an hour.&nbsp; And she lying
there looking as if she wouldn&rsquo;t live a day.&nbsp; But she
always hated me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said bitterly, &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t have worried her
like this.&nbsp; If she had not lived for another day you would
have had this house and everything else besides; a bigger bit
than even your wolfish throat can swallow, Mademoiselle
Therese.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I then said a few more things indicative of my disgust with
her rapacity, but they were quite inadequate, as I wasn&rsquo;t
able to find words strong enough to express my real mind.&nbsp;
But it didn&rsquo;t matter really because I don&rsquo;t think
Therese heard me at all.&nbsp; She seemed lost in rapt
amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say, my dear Monsieur?&nbsp; What!&nbsp;
All for me without any sort of paper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She appeared distracted by my curt: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Therese believed in my truthfulness.&nbsp; She believed me
implicitly, except when I was telling her the truth about
herself, mincing no words, when she used to stand smilingly
bashful as if I were overwhelming her with compliments.&nbsp; I
expected her to continue the horrible tale but apparently she had
found something to think about which checked the flow.&nbsp; She
fetched another sigh and muttered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the law can be just, if it does not require any
paper.&nbsp; After all, I am her sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very difficult to believe that&mdash;at
sight,&rdquo; I said roughly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but that I could prove.&nbsp; There are papers for
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this declaration she began to clear the table,
preserving a thoughtful silence.</p>
<p>I was not very surprised at the news of Do&ntilde;a
Rita&rsquo;s departure for Paris.&nbsp; It was not necessary to
ask myself why she had gone.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t even ask myself
whether she had left the leased Villa on the Prado for
ever.&nbsp; Later talking again with Therese, I learned that her
sister had given it up for the use of the Carlist cause and that
some sort of unofficial Consul, a Carlist agent of some sort,
either was going to live there or had already taken
possession.&nbsp; This, Rita herself had told her before her
departure on that agitated morning spent in the house&mdash;in my
rooms.&nbsp; A close investigation demonstrated to me that there
was nothing missing from them.&nbsp; Even the wretched match-box
which I really hoped was gone turned up in a drawer after I had,
delightedly, given it up.&nbsp; It was a great blow.&nbsp; She
might have taken that at least!&nbsp; She knew I used to carry it
about with me constantly while ashore.&nbsp; She might have taken
it!&nbsp; Apparently she meant that there should be no bond left
even of that kind; and yet it was a long time before I gave up
visiting and revisiting all the corners of all possible
receptacles for something that she might have left behind on
purpose.&nbsp; It was like the mania of those disordered minds
who spend their days hunting for a treasure.&nbsp; I hoped for a
forgotten hairpin, for some tiny piece of ribbon.&nbsp; Sometimes
at night I reflected that such hopes were altogether insensate;
but I remember once getting up at two in the morning to search
for a little cardboard box in the bathroom, into which, I
remembered, I had not looked before.&nbsp; Of course it was
empty; and, anyway, Rita could not possibly have known of its
existence.&nbsp; I got back to bed shivering violently, though
the night was warm, and with a distinct impression that this
thing would end by making me mad.&nbsp; It was no longer a
question of &ldquo;this sort of thing&rdquo; killing me.&nbsp;
The moral atmosphere of this torture was different.&nbsp; It
would make me mad.&nbsp; And at that thought great shudders ran
down my prone body, because, once, I had visited a famous lunatic
asylum where they had shown me a poor wretch who was mad,
apparently, because he thought he had been abominably fooled by a
woman.&nbsp; They told me that his grievance was quite
imaginary.&nbsp; He was a young man with a thin fair beard,
huddled up on the edge of his bed, hugging himself forlornly; and
his incessant and lamentable wailing filled the long bare
corridor, striking a chill into one&rsquo;s heart long before one
came to the door of his cell.</p>
<p>And there was no one from whom I could hear, to whom I could
speak, with whom I could evoke the image of Rita.&nbsp; Of course
I could utter that word of four letters to Therese; but Therese
for some reason took it into her head to avoid all topics
connected with her sister.&nbsp; I felt as if I could pull out
great handfuls of her hair hidden modestly under the black
handkerchief of which the ends were sometimes tied under her
chin.&nbsp; But, really, I could not have given her any
intelligible excuse for that outrage.&nbsp; Moreover, she was
very busy from the very top to the very bottom of the house,
which she persisted in running alone because she couldn&rsquo;t
make up her mind to part with a few francs every month to a
servant.&nbsp; It seemed to me that I was no longer such a
favourite with her as I used to be.&nbsp; That, strange to say,
was exasperating, too.&nbsp; It was as if some idea, some
fruitful notion had killed in her all the softer and more humane
emotions.&nbsp; She went about with brooms and dusters wearing an
air of sanctimonious thoughtfulness.</p>
<p>The man who to a certain extent took my place in
Therese&rsquo;s favour was the old father of the dancing girls
inhabiting the ground floor.&nbsp; In a tall hat and a well-to-do
dark blue overcoat he allowed himself to be button-holed in the
hall by Therese who would talk to him interminably with downcast
eyes.&nbsp; He smiled gravely down at her, and meanwhile tried to
edge towards the front door.&nbsp; I imagine he didn&rsquo;t put
a great value on Therese&rsquo;s favour.&nbsp; Our stay in
harbour was prolonged this time and I kept indoors like an
invalid.&nbsp; One evening I asked that old man to come in and
drink and smoke with me in the studio.&nbsp; He made no
difficulties to accept, brought his wooden pipe with him, and was
very entertaining in a pleasant voice.&nbsp; One couldn&rsquo;t
tell whether he was an uncommon person or simply a ruffian, but
in any case with his white beard he looked quite venerable.&nbsp;
Naturally he couldn&rsquo;t give me much of his company as he had
to look closely after his girls and their admirers; not that the
girls were unduly frivolous, but of course being very young they
had no experience.&nbsp; They were friendly creatures with
pleasant, merry voices and he was very much devoted to
them.&nbsp; He was a muscular man with a high colour and silvery
locks curling round his bald pate and over his ears, like a
<i>barocco</i> apostle.&nbsp; I had an idea that he had had a
lurid past and had seen some fighting in his youth.&nbsp; The
admirers of the two girls stood in great awe of him, from
instinct no doubt, because his behaviour to them was friendly and
even somewhat obsequious, yet always with a certain truculent
glint in his eye that made them pause in everything but their
generosity&mdash;which was encouraged.&nbsp; I sometimes wondered
whether those two careless, merry hard-working creatures
understood the secret moral beauty of the situation.</p>
<p>My real company was the dummy in the studio and I can&rsquo;t
say it was exactly satisfying.&nbsp; After taking possession of
the studio I had raised it tenderly, dusted its mangled limbs and
insensible, hard-wood bosom, and then had propped it up in a
corner where it seemed to take on, of itself, a shy
attitude.&nbsp; I knew its history.&nbsp; It was not an ordinary
dummy.&nbsp; One day, talking with Do&ntilde;a Rita about her
sister, I had told her that I thought Therese used to knock it
down on purpose with a broom, and Do&ntilde;a Rita had laughed
very much.&nbsp; This, she had said, was an instance of dislike
from mere instinct.&nbsp; That dummy had been made to measure
years before.&nbsp; It had to wear for days and days the Imperial
Byzantine robes in which Do&ntilde;a Rita sat only once or twice
herself; but of course the folds and bends of the stuff had to be
preserved as in the first sketch.&nbsp; Do&ntilde;a Rita
described amusingly how she had to stand in the middle of her
room while Rose walked around her with a tape measure noting the
figures down on a small piece of paper which was then sent to the
maker, who presently returned it with an angry letter stating
that those proportions were altogether impossible in any
woman.&nbsp; Apparently Rose had muddled them all up; and it was
a long time before the figure was finished and sent to the
Pavilion in a long basket to take on itself the robes and the
hieratic pose of the Empress.&nbsp; Later, it wore with the same
patience the marvellous hat of the &ldquo;Girl in the
Hat.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Do&ntilde;a Rita couldn&rsquo;t understand
how the poor thing ever found its way to Marseilles minus its
turnip head.&nbsp; Probably it came down with the robes and a
quantity of precious brocades which she herself had sent down
from Paris.&nbsp; The knowledge of its origin, the contempt of
Captain Blunt&rsquo;s references to it, with Therese&rsquo;s
shocked dislike of the dummy, invested that summary reproduction
with a sort of charm, gave me a faint and miserable illusion of
the original, less artificial than a photograph, less precise,
too. . . . But it can&rsquo;t be explained.&nbsp; I felt
positively friendly to it as if it had been Rita&rsquo;s trusted
personal attendant.&nbsp; I even went so far as to discover that
it had a sort of grace of its own.&nbsp; But I never went so far
as to address set speeches to it where it lurked shyly in its
corner, or drag it out from there for contemplation.&nbsp; I left
it in peace.&nbsp; I wasn&rsquo;t mad.&nbsp; I was only convinced
that I soon would be.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>
<p>Notwithstanding my misanthropy I had to see a few people on
account of all these Royalist affairs which I couldn&rsquo;t very
well drop, and in truth did not wish to drop.&nbsp; They were my
excuse for remaining in Europe, which somehow I had not the
strength of mind to leave for the West Indies, or
elsewhere.&nbsp; On the other hand, my adventurous pursuit kept
me in contact with the sea where I found occupation, protection,
consolation, the mental relief of grappling with concrete
problems, the sanity one acquires from close contact with simple
mankind, a little self-confidence born from the dealings with the
elemental powers of nature.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t give all that
up.&nbsp; And besides all this was related to Do&ntilde;a
Rita.&nbsp; I had, as it were, received it all from her own hand,
from that hand the clasp of which was as frank as a man&rsquo;s
and yet conveyed a unique sensation.&nbsp; The very memory of it
would go through me like a wave of heat.&nbsp; It was over that
hand that we first got into the habit of quarrelling, with the
irritability of sufferers from some obscure pain and yet half
unconscious of their disease.&nbsp; Rita&rsquo;s own spirit
hovered over the troubled waters of Legitimity.&nbsp; But as to
the sound of the four magic letters of her name I was not very
likely to hear it fall sweetly on my ear.&nbsp; For instance, the
distinguished personality in the world of finance with whom I had
to confer several times, alluded to the irresistible seduction of
the power which reigned over my heart and my mind; which had a
mysterious and unforgettable face, the brilliance of sunshine
together with the unfathomable splendour of the night
as&mdash;Madame de Lastaola.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s how that
steel-grey man called the greatest mystery of the universe.&nbsp;
When uttering that assumed name he would make for himself a
guardedly solemn and reserved face as though he were afraid lest
I should presume to smile, lest he himself should venture to
smile, and the sacred formality of our relations should be
outraged beyond mending.</p>
<p>He would refer in a studiously grave tone to Madame de
Lastaola&rsquo;s wishes, plans, activities, instructions,
movements; or picking up a letter from the usual litter of paper
found on such men&rsquo;s desks, glance at it to refresh his
memory; and, while the very sight of the handwriting would make
my lips go dry, would ask me in a bloodless voice whether
perchance I had &ldquo;a direct communication
from&mdash;er&mdash;Paris lately.&rdquo;&nbsp; And there would be
other maddening circumstances connected with those visits.&nbsp;
He would treat me as a serious person having a clear view of
certain eventualities, while at the very moment my vision could
see nothing but streaming across the wall at his back, abundant
and misty, unearthly and adorable, a mass of tawny hair that
seemed to have hot sparks tangled in it.&nbsp; Another nuisance
was the atmosphere of Royalism, of Legitimacy, that pervaded the
room, thin as air, intangible, as though no Legitimist of flesh
and blood had ever existed to the man&rsquo;s mind except perhaps
myself.&nbsp; He, of course, was just simply a banker, a very
distinguished, a very influential, and a very impeccable
banker.&nbsp; He persisted also in deferring to my judgment and
sense with an over-emphasis called out by his perpetual surprise
at my youth.&nbsp; Though he had seen me many times (I even knew
his wife) he could never get over my immature age.&nbsp; He
himself was born about fifty years old, all complete, with his
iron-grey whiskers and his bilious eyes, which he had the habit
of frequently closing during a conversation.&nbsp; On one
occasion he said to me.&nbsp; &ldquo;By the by, the Marquis of
Villarel is here for a time.&nbsp; He inquired after you the last
time he called on me.&nbsp; May I let him know that you are in
town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say anything to that.&nbsp; The Marquis of
Villarel was the Don Rafael of Rita&rsquo;s own story.&nbsp; What
had I to do with Spanish grandees?&nbsp; And for that matter what
had she, the woman of all time, to do with all the villainous or
splendid disguises human dust takes upon itself?&nbsp; All this
was in the past, and I was acutely aware that for me there was no
present, no future, nothing but a hollow pain, a vain passion of
such magnitude that being locked up within my breast it gave me
an illusion of lonely greatness with my miserable head uplifted
amongst the stars.&nbsp; But when I made up my mind (which I did
quickly, to be done with it) to call on the banker&rsquo;s wife,
almost the first thing she said to me was that the Marquis de
Villarel was &ldquo;amongst us.&rdquo;&nbsp; She said it
joyously.&nbsp; If in her husband&rsquo;s room at the bank
legitimism was a mere unpopulated principle, in her salon
Legitimacy was nothing but persons.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Il m&rsquo;a
caus&eacute; beaucoup de vous</i>,&rdquo; she said as if there
had been a joke in it of which I ought to be proud.&nbsp; I slunk
away from her.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t believe that the grandee
had talked to her about me.&nbsp; I had never felt myself part of
the great Royalist enterprise.&nbsp; I confess that I was so
indifferent to everything, so profoundly demoralized, that having
once got into that drawing-room I hadn&rsquo;t the strength to
get away; though I could see perfectly well my volatile hostess
going from one to another of her acquaintances in order to tell
them with a little gesture, &ldquo;Look!&nbsp; Over
there&mdash;in that corner.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the notorious
Monsieur George.&rdquo;&nbsp; At last she herself drove me out by
coming to sit by me vivaciously and going into ecstasies over
&ldquo;<i>ce cher</i> Monsieur Mills&rdquo; and that magnificent
Lord X; and ultimately, with a perfectly odious snap in the eyes
and drop in the voice, dragging in the name of Madame de Lastaola
and asking me whether I was really so much in the confidence of
that astonishing person.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Vous devez bien
regretter son d&eacute;part pour Paris</i>,&rdquo; she cooed,
looking with affected bashfulness at her fan. . . . How I got out
of the room I really don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; There was also a
staircase.&nbsp; I did not fall down it head first&mdash;that
much I am certain of; and I also remember that I wandered for a
long time about the seashore and went home very late, by the way
of the Prado, giving in passing a fearful glance at the
Villa.&nbsp; It showed not a gleam of light through the thin
foliage of its trees.</p>
<p>I spent the next day with Dominic on board the little craft
watching the shipwrights at work on her deck.&nbsp; From the way
they went about their business those men must have been perfectly
sane; and I felt greatly refreshed by my company during the
day.&nbsp; Dominic, too, devoted himself to his business, but his
taciturnity was sardonic.&nbsp; Then I dropped in at the
caf&eacute; and Madame L&eacute;onore&rsquo;s loud &ldquo;Eh,
Signorino, here you are at last!&rdquo; pleased me by its
resonant friendliness.&nbsp; But I found the sparkle of her black
eyes as she sat down for a moment opposite me while I was having
my drink rather difficult to bear.&nbsp; That man and that woman
seemed to know something.&nbsp; What did they know?&nbsp; At
parting she pressed my hand significantly.&nbsp; What did she
mean?&nbsp; But I didn&rsquo;t feel offended by these
manifestations.&nbsp; The souls within these people&rsquo;s
breasts were not volatile in the manner of slightly scented and
inflated bladders.&nbsp; Neither had they the impervious skins
which seem the rule in the fine world that wants only to get
on.&nbsp; Somehow they had sensed that there was something wrong;
and whatever impression they might have formed for themselves I
had the certitude that it would not be for them a matter of grins
at my expense.</p>
<p>That day on returning home I found Therese looking out for me,
a very unusual occurrence of late.&nbsp; She handed me a card
bearing the name of the Marquis de Villarel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you come by this?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp; She
turned on at once the tap of her volubility and I was not
surprised to learn that the grandee had not done such an
extraordinary thing as to call upon me in person.&nbsp; A young
gentleman had brought it.&nbsp; Such a nice young gentleman, she
interjected with her piously ghoulish expression.&nbsp; He was
not very tall.&nbsp; He had a very smooth complexion (that woman
was incorrigible) and a nice, tiny black moustache.&nbsp; Therese
was sure that he must have been an officer <i>en las filas
legitimas</i>.&nbsp; With that notion in her head she had asked
him about the welfare of that other model of charm and elegance,
Captain Blunt.&nbsp; To her extreme surprise the charming young
gentleman with beautiful eyes had apparently never heard of
Blunt.&nbsp; But he seemed very much interested in his
surroundings, looked all round the hall, noted the costly wood of
the door panels, paid some attention to the silver statuette
holding up the defective gas burner at the foot of the stairs,
and, finally, asked whether this was in very truth the house of
the most excellent Se&ntilde;ora Do&ntilde;a Rita de
Lastaola.&nbsp; The question staggered Therese, but with great
presence of mind she answered the young gentleman that she
didn&rsquo;t know what excellence there was about it, but that
the house was her property, having been given to her by her own
sister.&nbsp; At this the young gentleman looked both puzzled and
angry, turned on his heel, and got back into his fiacre.&nbsp;
Why should people be angry with a poor girl who had never done a
single reprehensible thing in her whole life?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose our Rita does tell people awful lies about
her poor sister.&rdquo;&nbsp; She sighed deeply (she had several
kinds of sighs and this was the hopeless kind) and added
reflectively, &ldquo;Sin on sin, wickedness on wickedness!&nbsp;
And the longer she lives the worse it will be.&nbsp; It would be
better for our Rita to be dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told &ldquo;Mademoiselle Therese&rdquo; that it was really
impossible to tell whether she was more stupid or atrocious; but
I wasn&rsquo;t really very much shocked.&nbsp; These outbursts
did not signify anything in Therese.&nbsp; One got used to
them.&nbsp; They were merely the expression of her rapacity and
her righteousness; so that our conversation ended by my asking
her whether she had any dinner ready for me that evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good of getting you anything to eat,
my dear young Monsieur,&rdquo; she quizzed me tenderly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You just only peck like a little bird.&nbsp; Much better
let me save the money for you.&rdquo;&nbsp; It will show the
super-terrestrial nature of my misery when I say that I was quite
surprised at Therese&rsquo;s view of my appetite.&nbsp; Perhaps
she was right.&nbsp; I certainly did not know.&nbsp; I stared
hard at her and in the end she admitted that the dinner was in
fact ready that very moment.</p>
<p>The new young gentleman within Therese&rsquo;s horizon
didn&rsquo;t surprise me very much.&nbsp; Villarel would travel
with some sort of suite, a couple of secretaries at least.&nbsp;
I had heard enough of Carlist headquarters to know that the man
had been (very likely was still) Captain General of the Royal
Bodyguard and was a person of great political (and domestic)
influence at Court.&nbsp; The card was, under its social form, a
mere command to present myself before the grandee.&nbsp; No
Royalist devoted by conviction, as I must have appeared to him,
could have mistaken the meaning.&nbsp; I put the card in my
pocket and after dining or not dining&mdash;I really don&rsquo;t
remember&mdash;spent the evening smoking in the studio, pursuing
thoughts of tenderness and grief, visions exalting and
cruel.&nbsp; From time to time I looked at the dummy.&nbsp; I
even got up once from the couch on which I had been writhing like
a worm and walked towards it as if to touch it, but refrained,
not from sudden shame but from sheer despair.&nbsp; By and by
Therese drifted in.&nbsp; It was then late and, I imagine, she
was on her way to bed.&nbsp; She looked the picture of cheerful,
rustic innocence and started propounding to me a conundrum which
began with the words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If our Rita were to die before long . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t get any further because I had jumped up and
frightened her by shouting: &ldquo;Is she ill?&nbsp; What has
happened?&nbsp; Have you had a letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had had a letter.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t ask her to show it
to me, though I daresay she would have done so.&nbsp; I had an
idea that there was no meaning in anything, at least no meaning
that mattered.&nbsp; But the interruption had made Therese
apparently forget her sinister conundrum.&nbsp; She observed me
with her shrewd, unintelligent eyes for a bit, and then with the
fatuous remark about the Law being just she left me to the
horrors of the studio.&nbsp; I believe I went to sleep there from
sheer exhaustion.&nbsp; Some time during the night I woke up
chilled to the bone and in the dark.&nbsp; These were horrors and
no mistake.&nbsp; I dragged myself upstairs to bed past the
indefatigable statuette holding up the ever-miserable
light.&nbsp; The black-and-white hall was like an ice-house.</p>
<p>The main consideration which induced me to call on the Marquis
of Villarel was the fact that after all I was a discovery of
Do&ntilde;a Rita&rsquo;s, her own recruit.&nbsp; My fidelity and
steadfastness had been guaranteed by her and no one else.&nbsp; I
couldn&rsquo;t bear the idea of her being criticized by every
empty-headed chatterer belonging to the Cause.&nbsp; And as,
apart from that, nothing mattered much, why, then&mdash;I would
get this over.</p>
<p>But it appeared that I had not reflected sufficiently on all
the consequences of that step.&nbsp; First of all the sight of
the Villa looking shabbily cheerful in the sunshine (but not
containing her any longer) was so perturbing that I very nearly
went away from the gate.&nbsp; Then when I got in after much
hesitation&mdash;being admitted by the man in the green baize
apron who recognized me&mdash;the thought of entering that room,
out of which she was gone as completely as if she had been dead,
gave me such an emotion that I had to steady myself against the
table till the faintness was past.&nbsp; Yet I was irritated as
at a treason when the man in the baize apron instead of letting
me into the Pompeiian dining-room crossed the hall to another
door not at all in the Pompeiian style (more Louis XV
rather&mdash;that Villa was like a <i>Salade Russe</i> of styles)
and introduced me into a big, light room full of very modern
furniture.&nbsp; The portrait <i>en pied</i> of an officer in a
sky-blue uniform hung on the end wall.&nbsp; The officer had a
small head, a black beard cut square, a robust body, and leaned
with gauntleted hands on the simple hilt of a straight
sword.&nbsp; That striking picture dominated a massive mahogany
desk, and, in front of this desk, a very roomy, tall-backed
armchair of dark green velvet.&nbsp; I thought I had been
announced into an empty room till glancing along the extremely
loud carpet I detected a pair of feet under the armchair.</p>
<p>I advanced towards it and discovered a little man, who had
made no sound or movement till I came into his view, sunk deep in
the green velvet.&nbsp; He altered his position slowly and rested
his hollow, black, quietly burning eyes on my face in prolonged
scrutiny.&nbsp; I detected something comminatory in his yellow,
emaciated countenance, but I believe now he was simply startled
by my youth.&nbsp; I bowed profoundly.&nbsp; He extended a meagre
little hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a chair, Don Jorge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was very small, frail, and thin, but his voice was not
languid, though he spoke hardly above his breath.&nbsp; Such was
the envelope and the voice of the fanatical soul belonging to the
Grand-master of Ceremonies and Captain General of the Bodyguard
at the Headquarters of the Legitimist Court, now detached on a
special mission.&nbsp; He was all fidelity, inflexibility, and
sombre conviction, but like some great saints he had very little
body to keep all these merits in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very young,&rdquo; he remarked, to begin
with.&nbsp; &ldquo;The matters on which I desired to converse
with you are very grave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was under the impression that your Excellency wished
to see me at once.&nbsp; But if your Excellency prefers it I will
return in, say, seven years&rsquo; time when I may perhaps be old
enough to talk about grave matters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t stir hand or foot and not even the quiver of
an eyelid proved that he had heard my shockingly unbecoming
retort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been recommended to us by a noble and loyal
lady, in whom His Majesty&mdash;whom God preserve&mdash;reposes
an entire confidence.&nbsp; God will reward her as she deserves
and you, too, Se&ntilde;or, according to the disposition you
bring to this great work which has the blessing (here he crossed
himself) of our Holy Mother the Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose your Excellency understands that in all this
I am not looking for reward of any kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this he made a faint, almost ethereal grimace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was speaking of the spiritual blessing which rewards
the service of religion and will be of benefit to your
soul,&rdquo; he explained with a slight touch of acidity.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The other is perfectly understood and your fidelity is
taken for granted.&nbsp; His Majesty&mdash;whom God
preserve&mdash;has been already pleased to signify his
satisfaction with your services to the most noble and loyal
Do&ntilde;a Rita by a letter in his own hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps he expected me to acknowledge this announcement in
some way, speech, or bow, or something, because before my
immobility he made a slight movement in his chair which smacked
of impatience.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am afraid, Se&ntilde;or, that you
are affected by the spirit of scoffing and irreverence which
pervades this unhappy country of France in which both you and I
are strangers, I believe.&nbsp; Are you a young man of that
sort?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a very good gun-runner, your Excellency,&rdquo; I
answered quietly.</p>
<p>He bowed his head gravely.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are aware.&nbsp;
But I was looking for the motives which ought to have their pure
source in religion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must confess frankly that I have not reflected on my
motives,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is enough for me to know
that they are not dishonourable and that anybody can see they are
not the motives of an adventurer seeking some sordid
advantage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had listened patiently and when he saw that there was
nothing more to come he ended the discussion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or, we should reflect upon our motives.&nbsp;
It is salutary for our conscience and is recommended (he crossed
himself) by our Holy Mother the Church.&nbsp; I have here certain
letters from Paris on which I would consult your young sagacity
which is accredited to us by the most loyal Do&ntilde;a
Rita.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sound of that name on his lips was simply odious.&nbsp; I
was convinced that this man of forms and ceremonies and fanatical
royalism was perfectly heartless.&nbsp; Perhaps he reflected on
his motives; but it seemed to me that his conscience could be
nothing else but a monstrous thing which very few actions could
disturb appreciably.&nbsp; Yet for the credit of Do&ntilde;a Rita
I did not withhold from him my young sagacity.&nbsp; What he
thought of it I don&rsquo;t know. The matters we discussed were
not of course of high policy, though from the point of view of
the war in the south they were important enough.&nbsp; We agreed
on certain things to be done, and finally, always out of regard
for Do&ntilde;a Rita&rsquo;s credit, I put myself generally at
his disposition or of any Carlist agent he would appoint in his
place; for I did not suppose that he would remain very long in
Marseilles.&nbsp; He got out of the chair laboriously, like a
sick child might have done.&nbsp; The audience was over but he
noticed my eyes wandering to the portrait and he said in his
measured, breathed-out tones:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I owe the pleasure of having this admirable work here
to the gracious attention of Madame de Lastaola, who, knowing my
attachment to the royal person of my Master, has sent it down
from Paris to greet me in this house which has been given up for
my occupation also through her generosity to the Royal
Cause.&nbsp; Unfortunately she, too, is touched by the infection
of this irreverent and unfaithful age.&nbsp; But she is young
yet.&nbsp; She is young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These last words were pronounced in a strange tone of menace
as though he were supernaturally aware of some suspended
disasters.&nbsp; With his burning eyes he was the image of an
Inquisitor with an unconquerable soul in that frail body.&nbsp;
But suddenly he dropped his eyelids and the conversation finished
as characteristically as it had begun: with a slow, dismissing
inclination of the head and an &ldquo;Adios,
Se&ntilde;or&mdash;may God guard you from sin.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>
<p>I must say that for the next three months I threw myself into
my unlawful trade with a sort of desperation, dogged and
hopeless, like a fairly decent fellow who takes deliberately to
drink.&nbsp; The business was getting dangerous.&nbsp; The bands
in the South were not very well organized, worked with no very
definite plan, and now were beginning to be pretty closely
hunted.&nbsp; The arrangements for the transport of supplies were
going to pieces; our friends ashore were getting scared; and it
was no joke to find after a day of skilful dodging that there was
no one at the landing place and have to go out again with our
compromising cargo, to slink and lurk about the coast for another
week or so, unable to trust anybody and looking at every vessel
we met with suspicion.&nbsp; Once we were ambushed by a lot of
&ldquo;rascally Carabineers,&rdquo; as Dominic called them, who
hid themselves among the rocks after disposing a train of mules
well in view on the seashore.&nbsp; Luckily, on evidence which I
could never understand, Dominic detected something
suspicious.&nbsp; Perhaps it was by virtue of some sixth sense
that men born for unlawful occupations may be gifted with.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There is a smell of treachery about this,&rdquo; he
remarked suddenly, turning at his oar.&nbsp; (He and I were
pulling alone in a little boat to reconnoitre.)&nbsp; I
couldn&rsquo;t detect any smell and I regard to this day our
escape on that occasion as, properly speaking, miraculous.&nbsp;
Surely some supernatural power must have struck upwards the
barrels of the Carabineers&rsquo; rifles, for they missed us by
yards.&nbsp; And as the Carabineers have the reputation of
shooting straight, Dominic, after swearing most horribly,
ascribed our escape to the particular guardian angel that looks
after crazy young gentlemen.&nbsp; Dominic believed in angels in
a conventional way, but laid no claim to having one of his
own.&nbsp; Soon afterwards, while sailing quietly at night, we
found ourselves suddenly near a small coasting vessel, also
without lights, which all at once treated us to a volley of rifle
fire.&nbsp; Dominic&rsquo;s mighty and inspired yell: &ldquo;<i>A
plat ventre</i>!&rdquo; and also an unexpected roll to windward
saved all our lives.&nbsp; Nobody got a scratch.&nbsp; We were
past in a moment and in a breeze then blowing we had the heels of
anything likely to give us chase.&nbsp; But an hour afterwards,
as we stood side by side peering into the darkness, Dominic was
heard to mutter through his teeth: &ldquo;<i>Le m&eacute;tier se
g&acirc;te</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; I, too, had the feeling that the
trade, if not altogether spoiled, had seen its best days.&nbsp;
But I did not care.&nbsp; In fact, for my purpose it was rather
better, a more potent influence; like the stronger intoxication
of raw spirit.&nbsp; A volley in the dark after all was not such
a bad thing.&nbsp; Only a moment before we had received it,
there, in that calm night of the sea full of freshness and soft
whispers, I had been looking at an enchanting turn of a head in a
faint light of its own, the tawny hair with snared red sparks
brushed up from the nape of a white neck and held up on high by
an arrow of gold feathered with brilliants and with ruby gleams
all along its shaft.&nbsp; That jewelled ornament, which I
remember often telling Rita was of a very Philistinish conception
(it was in some way connected with a tortoiseshell comb) occupied
an undue place in my memory, tried to come into some sort of
significance even in my sleep.&nbsp; Often I dreamed of her with
white limbs shimmering in the gloom like a nymph haunting a riot
of foliage, and raising a perfect round arm to take an arrow of
gold out of her hair to throw it at me by hand, like a
dart.&nbsp; It came on, a whizzing trail of light, but I always
woke up before it struck.&nbsp; Always.&nbsp; Invariably.&nbsp;
It never had a chance.&nbsp; A volley of small arms was much more
likely to do the business some day&mdash;or night.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>At last came the day when everything slipped out of my
grasp.&nbsp; The little vessel, broken and gone like the only toy
of a lonely child, the sea itself, which had swallowed it,
throwing me on shore after a shipwreck that instead of a fair
fight left in me the memory of a suicide.&nbsp; It took away all
that there was in me of independent life, but just failed to take
me out of the world, which looked then indeed like Another World
fit for no one else but unrepentant sinners.&nbsp; Even Dominic
failed me, his moral entity destroyed by what to him was a most
tragic ending of our common enterprise.&nbsp; The lurid swiftness
of it all was like a stunning thunder-clap&mdash;and, one
evening, I found myself weary, heartsore, my brain still dazed
and with awe in my heart entering Marseilles by way of the
railway station, after many adventures, one more disagreeable
than another, involving privations, great exertions, a lot of
difficulties with all sorts of people who looked upon me
evidently more as a discreditable vagabond deserving the
attentions of gendarmes than a respectable (if crazy) young
gentleman attended by a guardian angel of his own.&nbsp; I must
confess that I slunk out of the railway station shunning its many
lights as if, invariably, failure made an outcast of a man.&nbsp;
I hadn&rsquo;t any money in my pocket.&nbsp; I hadn&rsquo;t even
the bundle and the stick of a destitute wayfarer.&nbsp; I was
unshaven and unwashed, and my heart was faint within me.&nbsp; My
attire was such that I daren&rsquo;t approach the rank of
fiacres, where indeed I could perceive only two pairs of lamps,
of which one suddenly drove away while I looked.&nbsp; The other
I gave up to the fortunate of this earth.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t
believe in my power of persuasion.&nbsp; I had no powers.&nbsp; I
slunk on and on, shivering with cold, through the uproarious
streets.&nbsp; Bedlam was loose in them.&nbsp; It was the time of
Carnival.</p>
<p>Small objects of no value have the secret of sticking to a man
in an astonishing way.&nbsp; I had nearly lost my liberty and
even my life, I had lost my ship, a money-belt full of gold, I
had lost my companions, had parted from my friend; my occupation,
my only link with life, my touch with the sea, my cap and jacket
were gone&mdash;but a small penknife and a latchkey had never
parted company with me.&nbsp; With the latchkey I opened the door
of refuge.&nbsp; The hall wore its deaf-and-dumb air, its
black-and-white stillness.</p>
<p>The sickly gas-jet still struggled bravely with adversity at
the end of the raised silver arm of the statuette which had kept
to a hair&rsquo;s breadth its graceful pose on the toes of its
left foot; and the staircase lost itself in the shadows
above.&nbsp; Therese was parsimonious with the lights.&nbsp; To
see all this was surprising.&nbsp; It seemed to me that all the
things I had known ought to have come down with a crash at the
moment of the final catastrophe on the Spanish coast.&nbsp; And
there was Therese herself descending the stairs, frightened but
plucky.&nbsp; Perhaps she thought that she would be murdered this
time for certain.&nbsp; She had a strange, unemotional conviction
that the house was particularly convenient for a crime.&nbsp; One
could never get to the bottom of her wild notions which she held
with the stolidity of a peasant allied to the outward serenity of
a nun.&nbsp; She quaked all over as she came down to her doom,
but when she recognized me she got such a shock that she sat down
suddenly on the lowest step.&nbsp; She did not expect me for
another week at least, and, besides, she explained, the state I
was in made her blood take &ldquo;one turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed my plight seemed either to have called out or else
repressed her true nature.&nbsp; But who had ever fathomed her
nature!&nbsp; There was none of her treacly volubility.&nbsp;
There were none of her &ldquo;dear young gentlemans&rdquo; and
&ldquo;poor little hearts&rdquo; and references to sin.&nbsp; In
breathless silence she ran about the house getting my room ready,
lighting fires and gas-jets and even hauling at me to help me up
the stairs.&nbsp; Yes, she did lay hands on me for that
charitable purpose.&nbsp; They trembled.&nbsp; Her pale eyes
hardly left my face.&nbsp; &ldquo;What brought you here like
this?&rdquo; she whispered once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I were to tell you, Mademoiselle Therese, you would
see there the hand of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She dropped the extra pillow she was carrying and then nearly
fell over it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, dear heart,&rdquo; she murmured,
and ran off to the kitchen.</p>
<p>I sank into bed as into a cloud and Therese reappeared very
misty and offering me something in a cup.&nbsp; I believe it was
hot milk, and after I drank it she took the cup and stood looking
at me fixedly.&nbsp; I managed to say with difficulty: &ldquo;Go
away,&rdquo; whereupon she vanished as if by magic before the
words were fairly out of my mouth.&nbsp; Immediately afterwards
the sunlight forced through the slats of the jalousies its
diffused glow, and Therese was there again as if by magic, saying
in a distant voice: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s midday&rdquo;. . . Youth
will have its rights.&nbsp; I had slept like a stone for
seventeen hours.</p>
<p>I suppose an honourable bankrupt would know such an awakening:
the sense of catastrophe, the shrinking from the necessity of
beginning life again, the faint feeling that there are
misfortunes which must be paid for by a hanging.&nbsp; In the
course of the morning Therese informed me that the apartment
usually occupied by Mr. Blunt was vacant and added mysteriously
that she intended to keep it vacant for a time, because she had
been instructed to do so.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t imagine why
Blunt should wish to return to Marseilles.&nbsp; She told me also
that the house was empty except for myself and the two dancing
girls with their father.&nbsp; Those people had been away for
some time as the girls had engagements in some Italian summer
theatres, but apparently they had secured a re-engagement for the
winter and were now back.&nbsp; I let Therese talk because it
kept my imagination from going to work on subjects which, I had
made up my mind, were no concern of mine.&nbsp; But I went out
early to perform an unpleasant task.&nbsp; It was only proper
that I should let the Carlist agent ensconced in the Prado Villa
know of the sudden ending of my activities.&nbsp; It would be
grave enough news for him, and I did not like to be its bearer
for reasons which were mainly personal.&nbsp; I resembled Dominic
in so far that I, too, disliked failure.</p>
<p>The Marquis of Villarel had of course gone long before.&nbsp;
The man who was there was another type of Carlist altogether, and
his temperament was that of a trader.&nbsp; He was the chief
purveyor of the Legitimist armies, an honest broker of stores,
and enjoyed a great reputation for cleverness.&nbsp; His
important task kept him, of course, in France, but his young
wife, whose beauty and devotion to her King were well known,
represented him worthily at Headquarters, where his own
appearances were extremely rare.&nbsp; The dissimilar but united
loyalties of those two people had been rewarded by the title of
baron and the ribbon of some order or other.&nbsp; The gossip of
the Legitimist circles appreciated those favours with smiling
indulgence.&nbsp; He was the man who had been so distressed and
frightened by Do&ntilde;a Rita&rsquo;s first visit to
Tolosa.&nbsp; He had an extreme regard for his wife.&nbsp; And in
that sphere of clashing arms and unceasing intrigue nobody would
have smiled then at his agitation if the man himself hadn&rsquo;t
been somewhat grotesque.</p>
<p>He must have been startled when I sent in my name, for he
didn&rsquo;t of course expect to see me yet&mdash;nobody expected
me.&nbsp; He advanced soft-footed down the room.&nbsp; With his
jutting nose, flat-topped skull and sable garments he recalled an
obese raven, and when he heard of the disaster he manifested his
astonishment and concern in a most plebeian manner by a low and
expressive whistle.&nbsp; I, of course, could not share his
consternation.&nbsp; My feelings in that connection were of a
different order; but I was annoyed at his unintelligent
stare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you will take it on
yourself to advise Do&ntilde;a Rita, who is greatly interested in
this affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I was given to understand that Madame de
Lastaola was to leave Paris either yesterday or this
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was my turn to stare dumbly before I could manage to ask:
&ldquo;For Tolosa?&rdquo; in a very knowing tone.</p>
<p>Whether it was the droop of his head, play of light, or some
other subtle cause, his nose seemed to have grown perceptibly
longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, Se&ntilde;or, is the place where the news has got
to be conveyed without undue delay,&rdquo; he said in an agitated
wheeze.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could, of course, telegraph to our agent
in Bayonne who would find a messenger.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t
like, I don&rsquo;t like!&nbsp; The Alphonsists have agents, too,
who hang about the telegraph offices.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no use
letting the enemy get that news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was obviously very confused, unhappy, and trying to think
of two different things at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, Don George, sit down.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
absolutely forced a cigar on me.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am extremely
distressed.&nbsp; That&mdash;I mean Do&ntilde;a Rita is
undoubtedly on her way to Tolosa.&nbsp; This is very
frightful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I must say, however, that there was in the man some sense of
duty.&nbsp; He mastered his private fears.&nbsp; After some
cogitation he murmured: &ldquo;There is another way of getting
the news to Headquarters.&nbsp; Suppose you write me a formal
letter just stating the facts, the unfortunate facts, which I
will be able to forward.&nbsp; There is an agent of ours, a
fellow I have been employing for purchasing supplies, a perfectly
honest man.&nbsp; He is coming here from the north by the ten
o&rsquo;clock train with some papers for me of a confidential
nature.&nbsp; I was rather embarrassed about it.&nbsp; It
wouldn&rsquo;t do for him to get into any sort of trouble.&nbsp;
He is not very intelligent.&nbsp; I wonder, Don George, whether
you would consent to meet him at the station and take care of him
generally till to-morrow.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like the idea of
him going about alone.&nbsp; Then, to-morrow night, we would send
him on to Tolosa by the west coast route, with the news; and then
he can also call on Do&ntilde;a Rita who will no doubt be already
there. . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; He became again distracted all in a
moment and actually went so far as to wring his fat hands.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, yes, she will be there!&rdquo; he exclaimed in most
pathetic accents.</p>
<p>I was not in the humour to smile at anything, and he must have
been satisfied with the gravity with which I beheld his
extraordinary antics.&nbsp; My mind was very far away.&nbsp; I
thought: Why not?&nbsp; Why shouldn&rsquo;t I also write a letter
to Do&ntilde;a Rita, telling her that now nothing stood in the
way of my leaving Europe, because, really, the enterprise
couldn&rsquo;t be begun again; that things that come to an end
can never be begun again.&nbsp; The idea&mdash;never
again&mdash;had complete possession of my mind.&nbsp; I could
think of nothing else.&nbsp; Yes, I would write.&nbsp; The worthy
Commissary General of the Carlist forces was under the impression
that I was looking at him; but what I had in my eye was a jumble
of butterfly women and winged youths and the soft sheen of Argand
lamps gleaming on an arrow of gold in the hair of a head that
seemed to evade my outstretched hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I have nothing to do and
even nothing to think of just now, I will meet your man as he
gets off the train at ten o&rsquo;clock to-night.&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s he like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he has a black moustache and whiskers, and his chin
is shaved,&rdquo; said the newly-fledged baron cordially.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A very honest fellow.&nbsp; I always found him very
useful.&nbsp; His name is Jos&eacute; Ortega.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was perfectly self-possessed now, and walking soft-footed
accompanied me to the door of the room.&nbsp; He shook hands with
a melancholy smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is a very frightful
situation.&nbsp; My poor wife will be quite distracted.&nbsp; She
is such a patriot.&nbsp; Many thanks, Don George.&nbsp; You
relieve me greatly.&nbsp; The fellow is rather stupid and rather
bad-tempered.&nbsp; Queer creature, but very honest!&nbsp; Oh,
very honest!&rdquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>
<p>It was the last evening of Carnival.&nbsp; The same masks, the
same yells, the same mad rushes, the same bedlam of disguised
humanity blowing about the streets in the great gusts of mistral
that seemed to make them dance like dead leaves on an earth where
all joy is watched by death.</p>
<p>It was exactly twelve months since that other carnival evening
when I had felt a little weary and a little lonely but at peace
with all mankind.&nbsp; It must have been&mdash;to a day or
two.&nbsp; But on this evening it wasn&rsquo;t merely loneliness
that I felt.&nbsp; I felt bereaved with a sense of a complete and
universal loss in which there was perhaps more resentment than
mourning; as if the world had not been taken away from me by an
august decree but filched from my innocence by an underhand fate
at the very moment when it had disclosed to my passion its warm
and generous beauty.&nbsp; This consciousness of universal loss
had this advantage that it induced something resembling a state
of philosophic indifference.&nbsp; I walked up to the railway
station caring as little for the cold blasts of wind as though I
had been going to the scaffold.&nbsp; The delay of the train did
not irritate me in the least.&nbsp; I had finally made up my mind
to write a letter to Do&ntilde;a Rita; and this &ldquo;honest
fellow&rdquo; for whom I was waiting would take it to her.&nbsp;
He would have no difficulty in Tolosa in finding Madame de
Lastaola.&nbsp; The General Headquarters, which was also a Court,
would be buzzing with comments on her presence.&nbsp; Most likely
that &ldquo;honest fellow&rdquo; was already known to Do&ntilde;a
Rita.&nbsp; For all I knew he might have been her discovery just
as I was.&nbsp; Probably I, too, was regarded as an &ldquo;honest
fellow&rdquo; enough; but stupid&mdash;since it was clear that my
luck was not inexhaustible.&nbsp; I hoped that while carrying my
letter the man would not let himself be caught by some Alphonsist
guerilla who would, of course, shoot him.&nbsp; But why should
he?&nbsp; I, for instance, had escaped with my life from a much
more dangerous enterprise than merely passing through the
frontier line in charge of some trustworthy guide.&nbsp; I
pictured the fellow to myself trudging over the stony slopes and
scrambling down wild ravines with my letter to Do&ntilde;a Rita
in his pocket.&nbsp; It would be such a letter of farewell as no
lover had ever written, no woman in the world had ever read,
since the beginning of love on earth.&nbsp; It would be worthy of
the woman.&nbsp; No experience, no memories, no dead traditions
of passion or language would inspire it.&nbsp; She herself would
be its sole inspiration.&nbsp; She would see her own image in it
as in a mirror; and perhaps then she would understand what it was
I was saying farewell to on the very threshold of my life.&nbsp;
A breath of vanity passed through my brain.&nbsp; A letter as
moving as her mere existence was moving would be something
unique.&nbsp; I regretted I was not a poet.</p>
<p>I woke up to a great noise of feet, a sudden influx of people
through the doors of the platform.&nbsp; I made out my
man&rsquo;s whiskers at once&mdash;not that they were enormous,
but because I had been warned beforehand of their existence by
the excellent Commissary General.&nbsp; At first I saw nothing of
him but his whiskers: they were black and cut somewhat in the
shape of a shark&rsquo;s fin and so very fine that the least
breath of air animated them into a sort of playful
restlessness.&nbsp; The man&rsquo;s shoulders were hunched up and
when he had made his way clear of the throng of passengers I
perceived him as an unhappy and shivery being.&nbsp; Obviously he
didn&rsquo;t expect to be met, because when I murmured an
enquiring, &ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Ortega?&rdquo; into his ear he
swerved away from me and nearly dropped a little handbag he was
carrying.&nbsp; His complexion was uniformly pale, his mouth was
red, but not engaging.&nbsp; His social status was not very
definite.&nbsp; He was wearing a dark blue overcoat of no
particular cut, his aspect had no relief; yet those restless
side-whiskers flanking his red mouth and the suspicious
expression of his black eyes made him noticeable.&nbsp; This I
regretted the more because I caught sight of two skulking
fellows, looking very much like policemen in plain clothes,
watching us from a corner of the great hall.&nbsp; I hurried my
man into a fiacre.&nbsp; He had been travelling from early
morning on cross-country lines and after we got on terms a little
confessed to being very hungry and cold.&nbsp; His red lips
trembled and I noted an underhand, cynical curiosity when he had
occasion to raise his eyes to my face.&nbsp; I was in some doubt
how to dispose of him but as we rolled on at a jog trot I came to
the conclusion that the best thing to do would be to organize for
him a shake-down in the studio.&nbsp; Obscure lodging houses are
precisely the places most looked after by the police, and even
the best hotels are bound to keep a register of arrivals.&nbsp; I
was very anxious that nothing should stop his projected mission
of courier to headquarters.&nbsp; As we passed various street
corners where the mistral blast struck at us fiercely I could
feel him shivering by my side.&nbsp; However, Therese would have
lighted the iron stove in the studio before retiring for the
night, and, anyway, I would have to turn her out to make up a bed
on the couch.&nbsp; Service of the King!&nbsp; I must say that
she was amiable and didn&rsquo;t seem to mind anything one asked
her to do.&nbsp; Thus while the fellow slumbered on the divan I
would sit upstairs in my room setting down on paper those great
words of passion and sorrow that seethed in my brain and even
must have forced themselves in murmurs on to my lips, because the
man by my side suddenly asked me: &ldquo;What did you
say?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; I answered, very much
surprised.&nbsp; In the shifting light of the street lamps he
looked the picture of bodily misery with his chattering teeth and
his whiskers blown back flat over his ears.&nbsp; But somehow he
didn&rsquo;t arouse my compassion.&nbsp; He was swearing to
himself, in French and Spanish, and I tried to soothe him by the
assurance that we had not much farther to go.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am
starving,&rdquo; he remarked acidly, and I felt a little
compunction.&nbsp; Clearly, the first thing to do was to feed
him.&nbsp; We were then entering the Cannebi&egrave;re and as I
didn&rsquo;t care to show myself with him in the fashionable
restaurant where a new face (and such a face, too) would be
remarked, I pulled up the fiacre at the door of the Maison
Dor&eacute;e.&nbsp; That was more of a place of general resort
where, in the multitude of casual patrons, he would pass
unnoticed.</p>
<p>For this last night of carnival the big house had decorated
all its balconies with rows of coloured paper lanterns right up
to the roof.&nbsp; I led the way to the grand salon, for as to
private rooms they had been all retained days before.&nbsp; There
was a great crowd of people in costume, but by a piece of good
luck we managed to secure a little table in a corner.&nbsp; The
revellers, intent on their pleasure, paid no attention to
us.&nbsp; Se&ntilde;or Ortega trod on my heels and after sitting
down opposite me threw an ill-natured glance at the festive
scene.&nbsp; It might have been about half-past ten, then.</p>
<p>Two glasses of wine he drank one after another did not improve
his temper.&nbsp; He only ceased to shiver.&nbsp; After he had
eaten something it must have occurred to him that he had no
reason to bear me a grudge and he tried to assume a civil and
even friendly manner.&nbsp; His mouth, however, betrayed an
abiding bitterness.&nbsp; I mean when he smiled.&nbsp; In repose
it was a very expressionless mouth, only it was too red to be
altogether ordinary.&nbsp; The whole of him was like that: the
whiskers too black, the hair too shiny, the forehead too white,
the eyes too mobile; and he lent you his attention with an air of
eagerness which made you uncomfortable.&nbsp; He seemed to expect
you to give yourself away by some unconsidered word that he would
snap up with delight.&nbsp; It was that peculiarity that somehow
put me on my guard.&nbsp; I had no idea who I was facing across
the table and as a matter of fact I did not care.&nbsp; All my
impressions were blurred; and even the promptings of my instinct
were the haziest thing imaginable.&nbsp; Now and then I had acute
hallucinations of a woman with an arrow of gold in her
hair.&nbsp; This caused alternate moments of exaltation and
depression from which I tried to take refuge in conversation; but
Se&ntilde;or Ortega was not stimulating.&nbsp; He was preoccupied
with personal matters.&nbsp; When suddenly he asked me whether I
knew why he had been called away from his work (he had been
buying supplies from peasants somewhere in Central France), I
answered that I didn&rsquo;t know what the reason was originally,
but I had an idea that the present intention was to make of him a
courier, bearing certain messages from Baron H. to the Quartel
Real in Tolosa.</p>
<p>He glared at me like a basilisk.&nbsp; &ldquo;And why have I
been met like this?&rdquo; he enquired with an air of being
prepared to hear a lie.</p>
<p>I explained that it was the Baron&rsquo;s wish, as a matter of
prudence and to avoid any possible trouble which might arise from
enquiries by the police.</p>
<p>He took it badly.&nbsp; &ldquo;What nonsense.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
was&mdash;he said&mdash;an employ&eacute; (for several years) of
Hernandez Brothers in Paris, an importing firm, and he was
travelling on their business&mdash;as he could prove.&nbsp; He
dived into his side pocket and produced a handful of folded
papers of all sorts which he plunged back again instantly.</p>
<p>And even then I didn&rsquo;t know whom I had there, opposite
me, busy now devouring a slice of p&acirc;t&eacute; de foie
gras.&nbsp; Not in the least.&nbsp; It never entered my
head.&nbsp; How could it?&nbsp; The Rita that haunted me had no
history; she was but the principle of life charged with
fatality.&nbsp; Her form was only a mirage of desire decoying one
step by step into despair.</p>
<p>Se&ntilde;or Ortega gulped down some more wine and suggested I
should tell him who I was.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only right I
should know,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>This could not be gainsaid; and to a man connected with the
Carlist organization the shortest way was to introduce myself as
that &ldquo;Monsieur George&rdquo; of whom he had probably
heard.</p>
<p>He leaned far over the table, till his very breast-bone was
over the edge, as though his eyes had been stilettos and he
wanted to drive them home into my brain.&nbsp; It was only much
later that I understood how near death I had been at that
moment.&nbsp; But the knives on the tablecloth were the usual
restaurant knives with rounded ends and about as deadly as pieces
of hoop-iron.&nbsp; Perhaps in the very gust of his fury he
remembered what a French restaurant knife is like and something
sane within him made him give up the sudden project of cutting my
heart out where I sat.&nbsp; For it could have been nothing but a
sudden impulse.&nbsp; His settled purpose was quite other.&nbsp;
It was not my heart that he was after.&nbsp; His fingers indeed
were groping amongst the knife handles by the side of his plate
but what captivated my attention for a moment were his red lips
which were formed into an odd, sly, insinuating smile.&nbsp;
Heard!&nbsp; To be sure he had heard!&nbsp; The chief of the
great arms smuggling organization!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s giving me too
much importance.&rdquo;&nbsp; The person responsible and whom I
looked upon as chief of all the business was, as he might have
heard, too, a certain noble and loyal lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am as noble as she is,&rdquo; he snapped peevishly,
and I put him down at once as a very offensive beast.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And as to being loyal, what is that?&nbsp; It is being
truthful!&nbsp; It is being faithful!&nbsp; I know all about
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I managed to preserve an air of perfect unconcern.&nbsp; He
wasn&rsquo;t a fellow to whom one could talk of Do&ntilde;a
Rita.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a Basque,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>He admitted rather contemptuously that he was a Basque and
even then the truth did not dawn upon me.&nbsp; I suppose that
with the hidden egoism of a lover I was thinking of myself, of
myself alone in relation to Do&ntilde;a Rita, not of Do&ntilde;a
Rita herself.&nbsp; He, too, obviously.&nbsp; He said: &ldquo;I
am an educated man, but I know her people, all peasants.&nbsp;
There is a sister, an uncle, a priest, a peasant, too, and
perfectly unenlightened.&nbsp; One can&rsquo;t expect much from a
priest (I am a free-thinker of course), but he is really too bad,
more like a brute beast.&nbsp; As to all her people, mostly dead
now, they never were of any account.&nbsp; There was a little
land, but they were always working on other people&rsquo;s farms,
a barefooted gang, a starved lot.&nbsp; I ought to know because
we are distant relations.&nbsp; Twentieth cousins or something of
the sort.&nbsp; Yes, I am related to that most loyal lady.&nbsp;
And what is she, after all, but a Parisian woman with innumerable
lovers, as I have been told.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think your information is very
correct,&rdquo; I said, affecting to yawn slightly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This is mere gossip of the gutter and I am surprised at
you, who really know nothing about it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the disgusting animal had fallen into a brown study.&nbsp;
The hair of his very whiskers was perfectly still.&nbsp; I had
now given up all idea of the letter to Rita.&nbsp; Suddenly he
spoke again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Women are the origin of all evil.&nbsp; One should
never trust them.&nbsp; They have no honour.&nbsp; No
honour!&rdquo; he repeated, striking his breast with his closed
fist on which the knuckles stood out very white.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
left my village many years ago and of course I am perfectly
satisfied with my position and I don&rsquo;t know why I should
trouble my head about this loyal lady.&nbsp; I suppose
that&rsquo;s the way women get on in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt convinced that he was no proper person to be a
messenger to headquarters.&nbsp; He struck me as altogether
untrustworthy and perhaps not quite sane.&nbsp; This was
confirmed by him saying suddenly with no visible connection and
as if it had been forced from him by some agonizing process:
&ldquo;I was a boy once,&rdquo; and then stopping dead short with
a smile.&nbsp; He had a smile that frightened one by its
association of malice and anguish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you have anything more to eat?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>He declined dully.&nbsp; He had had enough.&nbsp; But he
drained the last of a bottle into his glass and accepted a cigar
which I offered him.&nbsp; While he was lighting it I had a sort
of confused impression that he wasn&rsquo;t such a stranger to me
as I had assumed he was; and yet, on the other hand, I was
perfectly certain I had never seen him before.&nbsp; Next moment
I felt that I could have knocked him down if he hadn&rsquo;t
looked so amazingly unhappy, while he came out with the
astounding question: &ldquo;Se&ntilde;or, have you ever been a
lover in your young days?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;How old
do you think I am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; he said, gazing at me in a
way in which the damned gaze out of their cauldrons of boiling
pitch at some soul walking scot free in the place of
torment.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true, you don&rsquo;t seem to
have anything on your mind.&rdquo;&nbsp; He assumed an air of
ease, throwing an arm over the back of his chair and blowing the
smoke through the gash of his twisted red mouth.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;between men, you know, has
this&mdash;wonderful celebrity&mdash;what does she call
herself?&nbsp; How long has she been your mistress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I reflected rapidly that if I knocked him over, chair and all,
by a sudden blow from the shoulder it would bring about infinite
complications beginning with a visit to the Commissaire de Police
on night-duty, and ending in God knows what scandal and
disclosures of political kind; because there was no telling what,
or how much, this outrageous brute might choose to say and how
many people he might not involve in a most undesirable
publicity.&nbsp; He was smoking his cigar with a poignantly
mocking air and not even looking at me.&nbsp; One can&rsquo;t hit
like that a man who isn&rsquo;t even looking at one; and then,
just as I was looking at him swinging his leg with a caustic
smile and stony eyes, I felt sorry for the creature.&nbsp; It was
only his body that was there in that chair.&nbsp; It was manifest
to me that his soul was absent in some hell of its own.&nbsp; At
that moment I attained the knowledge of who it was I had before
me.&nbsp; This was the man of whom both Do&ntilde;a Rita and Rose
were so much afraid.&nbsp; It remained then for me to look after
him for the night and then arrange with Baron H. that he should
be sent away the very next day&mdash;and anywhere but to
Tolosa.&nbsp; Yes, evidently, I mustn&rsquo;t lose sight of
him.&nbsp; I proposed in the calmest tone that we should go on
where he could get his much-needed rest.&nbsp; He rose with
alacrity, picked up his little hand-bag, and, walking out before
me, no doubt looked a very ordinary person to all eyes but
mine.&nbsp; It was then past eleven, not much, because we had not
been in that restaurant quite an hour, but the routine of the
town&rsquo;s night-life being upset during the Carnival the usual
row of fiacres outside the Maison Dor&eacute;e was not there; in
fact, there were very few carriages about.&nbsp; Perhaps the
coachmen had assumed Pierrot costumes and were rushing about the
streets on foot yelling with the rest of the population.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We will have to walk,&rdquo; I said after a
while.&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, yes, let us walk,&rdquo; assented
Se&ntilde;or Ortega, &ldquo;or I will be frozen
here.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was like a plaint of unutterable
wretchedness.&nbsp; I had a fancy that all his natural heat had
abandoned his limbs and gone to his brain.&nbsp; It was otherwise
with me; my head was cool but I didn&rsquo;t find the night
really so very cold.&nbsp; We stepped out briskly side by
side.&nbsp; My lucid thinking was, as it were, enveloped by the
wide shouting of the consecrated Carnival gaiety.&nbsp; I have
heard many noises since, but nothing that gave me such an
intimate impression of the savage instincts hidden in the breast
of mankind; these yells of festivity suggested agonizing fear,
rage of murder, ferocity of lust, and the irremediable
joylessness of human condition: yet they were emitted by people
who were convinced that they were amusing themselves supremely,
traditionally, with the sanction of ages, with the approval of
their conscience&mdash;and no mistake about it whatever!&nbsp;
Our appearance, the soberness of our gait made us
conspicuous.&nbsp; Once or twice, by common inspiration, masks
rushed forward and forming a circle danced round us uttering
discordant shouts of derision; for we were an outrage to the
peculiar proprieties of the hour, and besides we were obviously
lonely and defenceless.&nbsp; On those occasions there was
nothing for it but to stand still till the flurry was over.&nbsp;
My companion, however, would stamp his feet with rage, and I must
admit that I myself regretted not having provided for our wearing
a couple of false noses, which would have been enough to placate
the just resentment of those people.&nbsp; We might have also
joined in the dance, but for some reason or other it didn&rsquo;t
occur to us; and I heard once a high, clear woman&rsquo;s voice
stigmatizing us for a &ldquo;species of swelled heads&rdquo;
(<i>esp&egrave;ce d&rsquo;enfl&eacute;s</i>).&nbsp; We proceeded
sedately, my companion muttered with rage, and I was able to
resume my thinking.&nbsp; It was based on the deep persuasion
that the man at my side was insane with quite another than
Carnivalesque lunacy which comes on at one stated time of the
year.&nbsp; He was fundamentally mad, though not perhaps
completely; which of course made him all the greater, I
won&rsquo;t say danger but, nuisance.</p>
<p>I remember once a young doctor expounding the theory that most
catastrophes in family circles, surprising episodes in public
affairs and disasters in private life, had their origin in the
fact that the world was full of half-mad people.&nbsp; He
asserted that they were the real majority.&nbsp; When asked
whether he considered himself as belonging to the majority, he
said frankly that he didn&rsquo;t think so; unless the folly of
voicing this view in a company, so utterly unable to appreciate
all its horror, could be regarded as the first symptom of his own
fate.&nbsp; We shouted down him and his theory, but there is no
doubt that it had thrown a chill on the gaiety of our
gathering.</p>
<p>We had now entered a quieter quarter of the town and
Se&ntilde;or Ortega had ceased his muttering.&nbsp; For myself I
had not the slightest doubt of my own sanity.&nbsp; It was proved
to me by the way I could apply my intelligence to the problem of
what was to be done with Se&ntilde;or Ortega.&nbsp; Generally, he
was unfit to be trusted with any mission whatever.&nbsp; The
unstability of his temper was sure to get him into a
scrape.&nbsp; Of course carrying a letter to Headquarters was not
a very complicated matter; and as to that I would have trusted
willingly a properly trained dog.&nbsp; My private letter to
Do&ntilde;a Rita, the wonderful, the unique letter of farewell, I
had given up for the present.&nbsp; Naturally I thought of the
Ortega problem mainly in the terms of Do&ntilde;a Rita&rsquo;s
safety.&nbsp; Her image presided at every council, at every
conflict of my mind, and dominated every faculty of my
senses.&nbsp; It floated before my eyes, it touched my elbow, it
guarded my right side and my left side; my ears seemed to catch
the sound of her footsteps behind me, she enveloped me with
passing whiffs of warmth and perfume, with filmy touches of the
hair on my face.&nbsp; She penetrated me, my head was full of her
. . . And his head, too, I thought suddenly with a side glance at
my companion.&nbsp; He walked quietly with hunched-up shoulders
carrying his little hand-bag and he looked the most commonplace
figure imaginable.</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; There was between us a most horrible fellowship;
the association of his crazy torture with the sublime suffering
of my passion.&nbsp; We hadn&rsquo;t been a quarter of an hour
together when that woman had surged up fatally between us;
between this miserable wretch and myself.&nbsp; We were haunted
by the same image.&nbsp; But I was sane!&nbsp; I was sane!&nbsp;
Not because I was certain that the fellow must not be allowed to
go to Tolosa, but because I was perfectly alive to the difficulty
of stopping him from going there, since the decision was
absolutely in the hands of Baron H.</p>
<p>If I were to go early in the morning and tell that fat,
bilious man: &ldquo;Look here, your Ortega&rsquo;s mad,&rdquo; he
would certainly think at once that I was, get very frightened,
and . . . one couldn&rsquo;t tell what course he would
take.&nbsp; He would eliminate me somehow out of the
affair.&nbsp; And yet I could not let the fellow proceed to where
Do&ntilde;a Rita was, because, obviously, he had been molesting
her, had filled her with uneasiness and even alarm, was an
unhappy element and a disturbing influence in her
life&mdash;incredible as the thing appeared!&nbsp; I
couldn&rsquo;t let him go on to make himself a worry and a
nuisance, drive her out from a town in which she wished to be
(for whatever reason) and perhaps start some explosive
scandal.&nbsp; And that girl Rose seemed to fear something graver
even than a scandal.&nbsp; But if I were to explain the matter
fully to H. he would simply rejoice in his heart.&nbsp; Nothing
would please him more than to have Do&ntilde;a Rita driven out of
Tolosa.&nbsp; What a relief from his anxieties (and his
wife&rsquo;s, too); and if I were to go further, if I even went
so far as to hint at the fears which Rose had not been able to
conceal from me, why then&mdash;I went on thinking coldly with a
stoical rejection of the most elementary faith in mankind&rsquo;s
rectitude&mdash;why then, that accommodating husband would simply
let the ominous messenger have his chance.&nbsp; He would see
there only his natural anxieties being laid to rest for
ever.&nbsp; Horrible?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; But I could not take the
risk.&nbsp; In a twelvemonth I had travelled a long way in my
mistrust of mankind.</p>
<p>We paced on steadily.&nbsp; I thought: &ldquo;How on earth am
I going to stop you?&rdquo;&nbsp; Had this arisen only a month
before, when I had the means at hand and Dominic to confide in, I
would have simply kidnapped the fellow.&nbsp; A little trip to
sea would not have done Se&ntilde;or Ortega any harm; though no
doubt it would have been abhorrent to his feelings.&nbsp; But now
I had not the means.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t even tell where my
poor Dominic was hiding his diminished head.</p>
<p>Again I glanced at him sideways.&nbsp; I was the taller of the
two and as it happened I met in the light of the street lamp his
own stealthy glance directed up at me with an agonized
expression, an expression that made me fancy I could see the
man&rsquo;s very soul writhing in his body like an impaled
worm.&nbsp; In spite of my utter inexperience I had some notion
of the images that rushed into his mind at the sight of any man
who had approached Do&ntilde;a Rita.&nbsp; It was enough to
awaken in any human being a movement of horrified compassion; but
my pity went out not to him but to Do&ntilde;a Rita.&nbsp; It was
for her that I felt sorry; I pitied her for having that damned
soul on her track.&nbsp; I pitied her with tenderness and
indignation, as if this had been both a danger and a
dishonour.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to say that those thoughts passed through
my head consciously.&nbsp; I had only the resultant, settled
feeling.&nbsp; I had, however, a thought, too.&nbsp; It came on
me suddenly, and I asked myself with rage and astonishment:
&ldquo;Must I then kill that brute?&rdquo;&nbsp; There
didn&rsquo;t seem to be any alternative.&nbsp; Between him and
Do&ntilde;a Rita I couldn&rsquo;t hesitate.&nbsp; I believe I
gave a slight laugh of desperation.&nbsp; The suddenness of this
sinister conclusion had in it something comic and
unbelievable.&nbsp; It loosened my grip on my mental
processes.&nbsp; A Latin tag came into my head about the facile
descent into the abyss.&nbsp; I marvelled at its aptness, and
also that it should have come to me so pat.&nbsp; But I believe
now that it was suggested simply by the actual declivity of the
street of the Consuls which lies on a gentle slope.&nbsp; We had
just turned the corner.&nbsp; All the houses were dark and in a
perspective of complete solitude our two shadows dodged and
wheeled about our feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>He was an extraordinarily chilly devil.&nbsp; When we stopped
I could hear his teeth chattering again.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know
what came over me, I had a sort of nervous fit, was incapable of
finding my pockets, let alone the latchkey.&nbsp; I had the
illusion of a narrow streak of light on the wall of the house as
if it had been cracked.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope we will be able to
get in,&rdquo; I murmured.</p>
<p>Se&ntilde;or Ortega stood waiting patiently with his handbag,
like a rescued wayfarer.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you live in this house,
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, without hesitation.&nbsp; I
didn&rsquo;t know how that man would behave if he were aware that
I was staying under the same roof.&nbsp; He was half mad.&nbsp;
He might want to talk all night, try crazily to invade my
privacy.&nbsp; How could I tell?&nbsp; Moreover, I wasn&rsquo;t
so sure that I would remain in the house.&nbsp; I had some notion
of going out again and walking up and down the street of the
Consuls till daylight.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, an absent friend lets me
use . . . I had that latchkey this morning . . . Ah! here it
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I let him go in first.&nbsp; The sickly gas flame was there on
duty, undaunted, waiting for the end of the world to come and put
it out.&nbsp; I think that the black-and-white hall surprised
Ortega.&nbsp; I had closed the front door without noise and stood
for a moment listening, while he glanced about furtively.&nbsp;
There were only two other doors in the hall, right and
left.&nbsp; Their panels of ebony were decorated with bronze
applications in the centre.&nbsp; The one on the left was of
course Blunt&rsquo;s door.&nbsp; As the passage leading beyond it
was dark at the further end I took Se&ntilde;or Ortega by the
hand and led him along, unresisting, like a child.&nbsp; For some
reason or other I moved on tip-toe and he followed my
example.&nbsp; The light and the warmth of the studio impressed
him favourably; he laid down his little bag, rubbed his hands
together, and produced a smile of satisfaction; but it was such a
smile as a totally ruined man would perhaps force on his lips, or
a man condemned to a short shrift by his doctor.&nbsp; I begged
him to make himself at home and said that I would go at once and
hunt up the woman of the house who would make him up a bed on the
big couch there.&nbsp; He hardly listened to what I said.&nbsp;
What were all those things to him!&nbsp; He knew that his destiny
was to sleep on a bed of thorns, to feed on adders.&nbsp; But he
tried to show a sort of polite interest.&nbsp; He asked:
&ldquo;What is this place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It used to belong to a painter,&rdquo;&nbsp; I
mumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, your absent friend,&rdquo; he said, making a wry
mouth.&nbsp; &ldquo;I detest all those artists, and all those
writers, and all politicos who are thieves; and I would go even
farther and higher, laying a curse on all idle lovers of
women.&nbsp; You think perhaps I am a Royalist?&nbsp; No.&nbsp;
If there was anybody in heaven or hell to pray to I would pray
for a revolution&mdash;a red revolution everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You astonish me,&rdquo; I said, just to say
something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&nbsp; But there are half a dozen people in the
world with whom I would like to settle accounts.&nbsp; One could
shoot them like partridges and no questions asked.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s what revolution would mean to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a beautifully simple view,&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I imagine you are not the only one who holds
it; but I really must look after your comforts.&nbsp; You
mustn&rsquo;t forget that we have to see Baron H. early to-morrow
morning.&rdquo;&nbsp; And I went out quietly into the passage
wondering in what part of the house Therese had elected to sleep
that night.&nbsp; But, lo and behold, when I got to the foot of
the stairs there was Therese coming down from the upper regions
in her nightgown, like a sleep-walker.&nbsp; However, it
wasn&rsquo;t that, because, before I could exclaim, she vanished
off the first floor landing like a streak of white mist and
without the slightest sound.&nbsp; Her attire made it perfectly
clear that she could not have heard us coming in.&nbsp; In fact,
she must have been certain that the house was empty, because she
was as well aware as myself that the Italian girls after their
work at the opera were going to a masked ball to dance for their
own amusement, attended of course by their conscientious
father.&nbsp; But what thought, need, or sudden impulse had
driven Therese out of bed like this was something I
couldn&rsquo;t conceive.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t call out after her.&nbsp; I felt sure that she
would return.&nbsp; I went up slowly to the first floor and met
her coming down again, this time carrying a lighted candle.&nbsp;
She had managed to make herself presentable in an extraordinarily
short time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear young Monsieur, you have given me a
fright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; And I nearly fainted, too,&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You looked perfectly awful.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s
the matter with you?&nbsp; Are you ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had lighted by then the gas on the landing and I must say
that I had never seen exactly that manner of face on her
before.&nbsp; She wriggled, confused and shifty-eyed, before me;
but I ascribed this behaviour to her shocked modesty and without
troubling myself any more about her feelings I informed her that
there was a Carlist downstairs who must be put up for the
night.&nbsp; Most unexpectedly she betrayed a ridiculous
consternation, but only for a moment.&nbsp; Then she assumed at
once that I would give him hospitality upstairs where there was a
camp-bedstead in my dressing-room.&nbsp; I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; Give him a shake-down in the studio, where he
is now.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s warm in there.&nbsp; And remember! I
charge you strictly not to let him know that I sleep in this
house.&nbsp; In fact, I don&rsquo;t know myself that I will; I
have certain matters to attend to this very night.&nbsp; You will
also have to serve him his coffee in the morning.&nbsp; I will
take him away before ten o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this seemed to impress her more than I had expected.&nbsp;
As usual when she felt curious, or in some other way excited, she
assumed a saintly, detached expression, and asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dear gentleman is your friend, I
suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only know he is a Spaniard and a Carlist,&rdquo; I
said: &ldquo;and that ought to be enough for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of the usual effusive exclamations she murmured:
&ldquo;Dear me, dear me,&rdquo; and departed upstairs with the
candle to get together a few blankets and pillows, I
suppose.&nbsp; As for me I walked quietly downstairs on my way to
the studio.&nbsp; I had a curious sensation that I was acting in
a preordained manner, that life was not at all what I had thought
it to be, or else that I had been altogether changed sometime
during the day, and that I was a different person from the man
whom I remembered getting out of my bed in the morning.</p>
<p>Also feelings had altered all their values.&nbsp; The words,
too, had become strange.&nbsp; It was only the inanimate
surroundings that remained what they had always been.&nbsp; For
instance the studio. . . .</p>
<p>During my absence Se&ntilde;or Ortega had taken off his coat
and I found him as it were in the air, sitting in his shirt
sleeves on a chair which he had taken pains to place in the very
middle of the floor.&nbsp; I repressed an absurd impulse to walk
round him as though he had been some sort of exhibit.&nbsp; His
hands were spread over his knees and he looked perfectly
insensible.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mean strange, or ghastly, or
wooden, but just insensible&mdash;like an exhibit.&nbsp; And that
effect persisted even after he raised his black suspicious eyes
to my face.&nbsp; He lowered them almost at once.&nbsp; It was
very mechanical.&nbsp; I gave him up and became rather concerned
about myself.&nbsp; My thought was that I had better get out of
that before any more queer notions came into my head.&nbsp; So I
only remained long enough to tell him that the woman of the house
was bringing down some bedding and that I hoped that he would
have a good night&rsquo;s rest.&nbsp; And directly I spoke it
struck me that this was the most extraordinary speech that ever
was addressed to a figure of that sort.&nbsp; He, however, did
not seem startled by it or moved in any way.&nbsp; He simply
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the darkest part of the long passage outside I met Therese
with her arms full of pillows and blankets.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>
<p>Coming out of the bright light of the studio I didn&rsquo;t
make out Therese very distinctly.&nbsp; She, however, having
groped in dark cupboards, must have had her pupils sufficiently
dilated to have seen that I had my hat on my head.&nbsp; This has
its importance because after what I had said to her upstairs it
must have convinced her that I was going out on some midnight
business.&nbsp; I passed her without a word and heard behind me
the door of the studio close with an unexpected crash.&nbsp; It
strikes me now that under the circumstances I might have without
shame gone back to listen at the keyhole.&nbsp; But truth to say
the association of events was not so clear in my mind as it may
be to the reader of this story.&nbsp; Neither were the exact
connections of persons present to my mind.&nbsp; And, besides,
one doesn&rsquo;t listen at a keyhole but in pursuance of some
plan; unless one is afflicted by a vulgar and fatuous
curiosity.&nbsp; But that vice is not in my character.&nbsp; As
to plan, I had none.&nbsp; I moved along the passage between the
dead wall and the black-and-white marble elevation of the
staircase with hushed footsteps, as though there had been a
mortally sick person somewhere in the house.&nbsp; And the only
person that could have answered to that description was
Se&ntilde;or Ortega.&nbsp; I moved on, stealthy, absorbed,
undecided; asking myself earnestly: &ldquo;What on earth am I
going to do with him?&rdquo;&nbsp; That exclusive preoccupation
of my mind was as dangerous to Se&ntilde;or Ortega as typhoid
fever would have been.&nbsp; It strikes me that this comparison
is very exact.&nbsp; People recover from typhoid fever, but
generally the chance is considered poor.&nbsp; This was precisely
his case.&nbsp; His chance was poor; though I had no more
animosity towards him than a virulent disease has against the
victim it lays low.&nbsp; He really would have nothing to
reproach me with; he had run up against me, unwittingly, as a man
enters an infected place, and now he was very ill, very ill
indeed.&nbsp; No, I had no plans against him.&nbsp; I had only
the feeling that he was in mortal danger.</p>
<p>I believe that men of the most daring character (and I make no
claim to it) often do shrink from the logical processes of
thought.&nbsp; It is only the devil, they say, that loves
logic.&nbsp; But I was not a devil.&nbsp; I was not even a victim
of the devil.&nbsp; It was only that I had given up the direction
of my intelligence before the problem; or rather that the problem
had dispossessed my intelligence and reigned in its stead side by
side with a superstitious awe.&nbsp; A dreadful order seemed to
lurk in the darkest shadows of life.&nbsp; The madness of that
Carlist with the soul of a Jacobin, the vile fears of Baron H.,
that excellent organizer of supplies, the contact of their two
ferocious stupidities, and last, by a remote disaster at sea, my
love brought into direct contact with the situation: all that was
enough to make one shudder&mdash;not at the chance, but at the
design.</p>
<p>For it was my love that was called upon to act here, and
nothing else.&nbsp; And love which elevates us above all
safeguards, above restraining principles, above all littlenesses
of self-possession, yet keeps its feet always firmly on earth,
remains marvellously practical in its suggestions.</p>
<p>I discovered that however much I had imagined I had given up
Rita, that whatever agonies I had gone through, my hope of her
had never been lost.&nbsp; Plucked out, stamped down, torn to
shreds, it had remained with me secret, intact, invincible.&nbsp;
Before the danger of the situation it sprang, full of life, up in
arms&mdash;the undying child of immortal love.&nbsp; What incited
me was independent of honour and compassion; it was the prompting
of a love supreme, practical, remorseless in its aim; it was the
practical thought that no woman need be counted as lost for ever,
unless she be dead!</p>
<p>This excluded for the moment all considerations of ways and
means and risks and difficulties.&nbsp; Its tremendous intensity
robbed it of all direction and left me adrift in the big
black-and-white hall as on a silent sea.&nbsp; It was not,
properly speaking, irresolution.&nbsp; It was merely hesitation
as to the next immediate step, and that step even of no great
importance: hesitation merely as to the best way I could spend
the rest of the night.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t think further forward
for many reasons, more or less optimistic, but mainly because I
have no homicidal vein in my composition.&nbsp; The disposition
to gloat over homicide was in that miserable creature in the
studio, the potential Jacobin; in that confounded buyer of
agricultural produce, the punctual employ&eacute; of Hernandez
Brothers, the jealous wretch with an obscene tongue and an
imagination of the same kind to drive him mad.&nbsp; I thought of
him without pity but also without contempt.&nbsp; I reflected
that there were no means of sending a warning to Do&ntilde;a Rita
in Tolosa; for of course no postal communication existed with the
Headquarters.&nbsp; And moreover what would a warning be worth in
this particular case, supposing it would reach her, that she
would believe it, and that she would know what to do?&nbsp; How
could I communicate to another that certitude which was in my
mind, the more absolute because without proofs that one could
produce?</p>
<p>The last expression of Rose&rsquo;s distress rang again in my
ears: &ldquo;Madame has no friends.&nbsp; Not one!&rdquo; and I
saw Do&ntilde;a Rita&rsquo;s complete loneliness beset by all
sorts of insincerities, surrounded by pitfalls; her greatest
dangers within herself, in her generosity, in her fears, in her
courage, too.&nbsp; What I had to do first of all was to stop
that wretch at all costs.&nbsp; I became aware of a great
mistrust of Therese.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t want her to find me in
the hall, but I was reluctant to go upstairs to my rooms from an
unreasonable feeling that there I would be too much out of the
way; not sufficiently on the spot.&nbsp; There was the
alternative of a live-long night of watching outside, before the
dark front of the house.&nbsp; It was a most distasteful
prospect.&nbsp; And then it occurred to me that Blunt&rsquo;s
former room would be an extremely good place to keep a watch
from.&nbsp; I knew that room.&nbsp; When Henry All&egrave;gre
gave the house to Rita in the early days (long before he made his
will) he had planned a complete renovation and this room had been
meant for the drawing-room.&nbsp; Furniture had been made for it
specially, upholstered in beautiful ribbed stuff, made to order,
of dull gold colour with a pale blue tracery of arabesques and
oval medallions enclosing Rita&rsquo;s monogram, repeated on the
backs of chairs and sofas, and on the heavy curtains reaching
from ceiling to floor.&nbsp; To the same time belonged the ebony
and bronze doors, the silver statuette at the foot of the stairs,
the forged iron balustrade reproducing right up the marble
staircase Rita&rsquo;s decorative monogram in its complicated
design.&nbsp; Afterwards the work was stopped and the house had
fallen into disrepair.&nbsp; When Rita devoted it to the Carlist
cause a bed was put into that drawing-room, just simply the
bed.&nbsp; The room next to that yellow salon had been in
All&egrave;gre&rsquo;s young days fitted as a fencing-room
containing also a bath, and a complicated system of all sorts of
shower and jet arrangements, then quite up to date.&nbsp; That
room was very large, lighted from the top, and one wall of it was
covered by trophies of arms of all sorts, a choice collection of
cold steel disposed on a background of Indian mats and rugs:
Blunt used it as a dressing-room.&nbsp; It communicated by a
small door with the studio.</p>
<p>I had only to extend my hand and make one step to reach the
magnificent bronze handle of the ebony door, and if I
didn&rsquo;t want to be caught by Therese there was no time to
lose.&nbsp; I made the step and extended the hand, thinking that
it would be just like my luck to find the door locked.&nbsp; But
the door came open to my push.&nbsp; In contrast to the dark hall
the room was most unexpectedly dazzling to my eyes, as if
illuminated <i>a giorno</i> for a reception.&nbsp; No voice came
from it, but nothing could have stopped me now.&nbsp; As I turned
round to shut the door behind me noiselessly I caught sight of a
woman&rsquo;s dress on a chair, of other articles of apparel
scattered about.&nbsp; The mahogany bed with a piece of light
silk which Therese found somewhere and used for a counterpane was
a magnificent combination of white and crimson between the
gleaming surfaces of dark wood; and the whole room had an air of
splendour with marble consoles, gilt carvings, long mirrors and a
sumptuous Venetian lustre depending from the ceiling: a darkling
mass of icy pendants catching a spark here and there from the
candles of an eight-branched candelabra standing on a little
table near the head of a sofa which had been dragged round to
face the fireplace.&nbsp; The faintest possible whiff of a
familiar perfume made my head swim with its suggestion.</p>
<p>I grabbed the back of the nearest piece of furniture and the
splendour of marbles and mirrors, of cut crystals and carvings,
swung before my eyes in the golden mist of walls and draperies
round an extremely conspicuous pair of black stockings thrown
over a music stool which remained motionless.&nbsp; The silence
was profound.&nbsp; It was like being in an enchanted
place.&nbsp; Suddenly a voice began to speak, clear, detached,
infinitely touching in its calm weariness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you tormented me enough to-day?&rdquo; it
said. . . . My head was steady now but my heart began to beat
violently.&nbsp; I listened to the end without moving,
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you make up your mind to leave me alone for
to-night?&rdquo;&nbsp; It pleaded with an accent of charitable
scorn.</p>
<p>The penetrating quality of these tones which I had not heard
for so many, many days made my eyes run full of tears.&nbsp; I
guessed easily that the appeal was addressed to the atrocious
Therese.&nbsp; The speaker was concealed from me by the high back
of the sofa, but her apprehension was perfectly justified.&nbsp;
For was it not I who had turned back Therese the pious, the
insatiable, coming downstairs in her nightgown to torment her
sister some more?&nbsp; Mere surprise at Do&ntilde;a Rita&rsquo;s
presence in the house was enough to paralyze me; but I was also
overcome by an enormous sense of relief, by the assurance of
security for her and for myself.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t even ask
myself how she came there.&nbsp; It was enough for me that she
was not in Tolosa.&nbsp; I could have smiled at the thought that
all I had to do now was to hasten the departure of that
abominable lunatic&mdash;for Tolosa: an easy task, almost no task
at all.&nbsp; Yes, I would have smiled, had not I felt outraged
by the presence of Se&ntilde;or Ortega under the same roof with
Do&ntilde;a Rita.&nbsp; The mere fact was repugnant to me,
morally revolting; so that I should have liked to rush at him and
throw him out into the street.&nbsp; But that was not to be done
for various reasons.&nbsp; One of them was pity.&nbsp; I was
suddenly at peace with all mankind, with all nature.&nbsp; I felt
as if I couldn&rsquo;t hurt a fly.&nbsp; The intensity of my
emotion sealed my lips.&nbsp; With a fearful joy tugging at my
heart I moved round the head of the couch without a word.</p>
<p>In the wide fireplace on a pile of white ashes the logs had a
deep crimson glow; and turned towards them Do&ntilde;a Rita
reclined on her side enveloped in the skins of wild beasts like a
charming and savage young chieftain before a camp fire.&nbsp; She
never even raised her eyes, giving me the opportunity to
contemplate mutely that adolescent, delicately masculine head, so
mysteriously feminine in the power of instant seduction, so
infinitely suave in its firm design, almost childlike in the
freshness of detail: altogether ravishing in the inspired
strength of the modelling.&nbsp; That precious head reposed in
the palm of her hand; the face was slightly flushed (with anger
perhaps).&nbsp; She kept her eyes obstinately fixed on the pages
of a book which she was holding with her other hand.&nbsp; I had
the time to lay my infinite adoration at her feet whose white
insteps gleamed below the dark edge of the fur out of quilted
blue silk bedroom slippers, embroidered with small pearls.&nbsp;
I had never seen them before; I mean the slippers.&nbsp; The
gleam of the insteps, too, for that matter.&nbsp; I lost myself
in a feeling of deep content, something like a foretaste of a
time of felicity which must be quiet or it couldn&rsquo;t be
eternal.&nbsp; I had never tasted such perfect quietness
before.&nbsp; It was not of this earth.&nbsp; I had gone far
beyond.&nbsp; It was as if I had reached the ultimate wisdom
beyond all dreams and all passions.&nbsp; She was That which is
to be contemplated to all Infinity.</p>
<p>The perfect stillness and silence made her raise her eyes at
last, reluctantly, with a hard, defensive expression which I had
never seen in them before.&nbsp; And no wonder!&nbsp; The glance
was meant for Therese and assumed in self-defence.&nbsp; For some
time its character did not change and when it did it turned into
a perfectly stony stare of a kind which I also had never seen
before.&nbsp; She had never wished so much to be left in
peace.&nbsp; She had never been so astonished in her life.&nbsp;
She had arrived by the evening express only two hours before
Se&ntilde;or Ortega, had driven to the house, and after having
something to eat had become for the rest of the evening the
helpless prey of her sister who had fawned and scolded and
wheedled and threatened in a way that outraged all Rita&rsquo;s
feelings.&nbsp; Seizing this unexpected occasion Therese had
displayed a distracting versatility of sentiment: rapacity,
virtue, piety, spite, and false tenderness&mdash;while,
characteristically enough, she unpacked the dressing-bag, helped
the sinner to get ready for bed, brushed her hair, and finally,
as a climax, kissed her hands, partly by surprise and partly by
violence.&nbsp; After that she had retired from the field of
battle slowly, undefeated, still defiant, firing as a last shot
the impudent question: &ldquo;Tell me only, have you made your
will, Rita?&rdquo;&nbsp; To this poor Do&ntilde;a Rita with the
spirit of opposition strung to the highest pitch answered:
&ldquo;No, and I don&rsquo;t mean to&rdquo;&mdash;being under the
impression that this was what her sister wanted her to do.&nbsp;
There can be no doubt, however, that all Therese wanted was the
information.</p>
<p>Rita, much too agitated to expect anything but a sleepless
night, had not the courage to get into bed.&nbsp; She thought she
would remain on the sofa before the fire and try to compose
herself with a book.&nbsp; As she had no dressing-gown with her
she put on her long fur coat over her night-gown, threw some logs
on the fire, and lay down.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t hear the
slightest noise of any sort till she heard me shut the door
gently.&nbsp; Quietness of movement was one of Therese&rsquo;s
accomplishments, and the harassed heiress of the All&egrave;gre
millions naturally thought it was her sister coming again to
renew the scene.&nbsp; Her heart sank within her.&nbsp; In the
end she became a little frightened at the long silence, and
raised her eyes.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t believe them for a long
time.&nbsp; She concluded that I was a vision.&nbsp; In fact, the
first word which I heard her utter was a low, awed
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; which, though I understood its meaning, chilled
my blood like an evil omen.</p>
<p>It was then that I spoke.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s me that you see,&rdquo; and made a step
forward.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t start; only her other hand flew
to the edges of the fur coat, gripping them together over her
breast.&nbsp; Observing this gesture I sat down in the nearest
chair.&nbsp; The book she had been reading slipped with a thump
on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is it possible that you should be here?&rdquo; she
said, still in a doubting voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am really here,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Would you
like to touch my hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t move at all; her fingers still clutched the
fur coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long story, but you may take it from me
that all is over.&nbsp; The tie between us is broken.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know that it was ever very close.&nbsp; It was an
external thing.&nbsp; The true misfortune is that I have ever
seen you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This last phrase was provoked by an exclamation of sympathy on
her part.&nbsp; She raised herself on her elbow and looked at me
intently.&nbsp; &ldquo;All over,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we had to wreck the little vessel.&nbsp; It was
awful.&nbsp; I feel like a murderer.&nbsp; But she had to be
killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I loved her too much.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you
know that love and death go very close together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could feel almost happy that it is all over, if you
hadn&rsquo;t had to lose your love.&nbsp; Oh, <i>amigo</i>
George, it was a safe love for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was a faithful
little vessel.&nbsp; She would have saved us all from any plain
danger.&nbsp; But this was a betrayal.&nbsp; It was&mdash;never
mind.&nbsp; All that&rsquo;s past.&nbsp; The question is what
will the next one be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should it be that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; Life seems but a series of
betrayals.&nbsp; There are so many kinds of them.&nbsp; This was
a betrayed plan, but one can betray confidence, and hope
and&mdash;desire, and the most sacred . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what are you doing here?&rdquo; she
interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&nbsp; The eternal why.&nbsp; Till a few hours
ago I didn&rsquo;t know what I was here for.&nbsp; And what are
you here for?&rdquo; I asked point blank and with a bitterness
she disregarded.&nbsp; She even answered my question quite
readily with many words out of which I could make very
little.&nbsp; I only learned that for at least five mixed
reasons, none of which impressed me profoundly, Do&ntilde;a Rita
had started at a moment&rsquo;s notice from Paris with nothing
but a dressing-bag, and permitting Rose to go and visit her aged
parents for two days, and then follow her mistress.&nbsp; That
girl of late had looked so perturbed and worried that the
sensitive Rita, fearing that she was tired of her place, proposed
to settle a sum of money on her which would have enabled her to
devote herself entirely to her aged parents.&nbsp; And did I know
what that extraordinary girl said?&nbsp; She had said:
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let Madame think that I would be too proud to
accept anything whatever from her; but I can&rsquo;t even dream
of leaving Madame.&nbsp; I believe Madame has no friends.&nbsp;
Not one.&rdquo;&nbsp; So instead of a large sum of money
Do&ntilde;a Rita gave the girl a kiss and as she had been worried
by several people who wanted her to go to Tolosa she bolted down
this way just to get clear of all those busybodies.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hide from them,&rdquo; she went on with ardour.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, I came here to hide,&rdquo; she repeated twice as if
delighted at last to have hit on that reason among so many
others.&nbsp; &ldquo;How could I tell that you would be
here?&rdquo;&nbsp; Then with sudden fire which only added to the
delight with which I had been watching the play of her
physiognomy she added: &ldquo;Why did you come into this
room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She enchanted me.&nbsp; The ardent modulations of the sound,
the slight play of the beautiful lips, the still, deep sapphire
gleam in those long eyes inherited from the dawn of ages and that
seemed always to watch unimaginable things, that underlying faint
ripple of gaiety that played under all her moods as though it had
been a gift from the high gods moved to pity for this lonely
mortal, all this within the four walls and displayed for me alone
gave me the sense of almost intolerable joy.&nbsp; The words
didn&rsquo;t matter.&nbsp; They had to be answered, of
course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came in for several reasons.&nbsp; One of them is
that I didn&rsquo;t know you were here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therese didn&rsquo;t tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never talked to you about me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hesitated only for a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; Then I asked in my turn, &ldquo;Did she tell you I
was here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very clear she did not mean us to come
together again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither did I, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by speaking like this, in this tone,
in these words?&nbsp; You seem to use them as if they were a sort
of formula.&nbsp; Am I a dear to you?&nbsp; Or is anybody? . . .
or everybody? . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had been for some time raised on her elbow, but then as if
something had happened to her vitality she sank down till her
head rested again on the sofa cushion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you try to hurt my feelings?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the same reason for which you call me dear at the
end of a sentence like that: for want of something more amusing
to do.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t pretend to make me believe that you
do it for any sort of reason that a decent person would confess
to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The colour had gone from her face; but a fit of wickedness was
on me and I pursued, &ldquo;What are the motives of your
speeches?&nbsp; What prompts your actions?&nbsp; On your own
showing your life seems to be a continuous running away.&nbsp;
You have just run away from Paris.&nbsp; Where will you run
to-morrow?&nbsp; What are you everlastingly running from&mdash;or
is it that you are running after something?&nbsp; What is
it?&nbsp; A man, a phantom&mdash;or some sensation that you
don&rsquo;t like to own to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truth to say, I was abashed by the silence which was her only
answer to this sally.&nbsp; I said to myself that I would not let
my natural anger, my just fury be disarmed by any assumption of
pathos or dignity.&nbsp; I suppose I was really out of my mind
and what in the middle ages would have been called
&ldquo;possessed&rdquo; by an evil spirit.&nbsp; I went on
enjoying my own villainy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you in Tolosa?&nbsp; You ought to be
in Tolosa.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t Tolosa the proper field for your
abilities, for your sympathies, for your profusions, for your
generosities&mdash;the king without a crown, the man without a
fortune!&nbsp; But here there is nothing worthy of your
talents.&nbsp; No, there is no longer anything worth any sort of
trouble here.&nbsp; There isn&rsquo;t even that ridiculous
Monsieur George.&nbsp; I understand that the talk of the coast
from here to Cette is that Monsieur George is drowned.&nbsp; Upon
my word I believe he is.&nbsp; And serve him right, too.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s Therese, but I don&rsquo;t suppose that your love
for your sister . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For goodness&rsquo; sake don&rsquo;t let her come in
and find you here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those words recalled me to myself, exorcised the evil spirit
by the mere enchanting power of the voice.&nbsp; They were also
impressive by their suggestion of something practical,
utilitarian, and remote from sentiment.&nbsp; The evil spirit
left me and I remained taken aback slightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;if you mean that you want
me to leave the room I will confess to you that I can&rsquo;t
very well do it yet.&nbsp; But I could lock both doors if you
don&rsquo;t mind that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do what you like as long as you keep her out.&nbsp; You
two together would be too much for me to-night.&nbsp; Why
don&rsquo;t you go and lock those doors?&nbsp; I have a feeling
she is on the prowl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I got up at once saying, &ldquo;I imagine she has gone to bed
by this time.&rdquo;&nbsp; I felt absolutely calm and
responsible.&nbsp; I turned the keys one after another so gently
that I couldn&rsquo;t hear the click of the locks myself.&nbsp;
This done I recrossed the room with measured steps, with downcast
eyes, and approaching the couch without raising them from the
carpet I sank down on my knees and leaned my forehead on its
edge.&nbsp; That penitential attitude had but little remorse in
it.&nbsp; I detected no movement and heard no sound from
her.&nbsp; In one place a bit of the fur coat touched my cheek
softly, but no forgiving hand came to rest on my bowed
head.&nbsp; I only breathed deeply the faint scent of violets,
her own particular fragrance enveloping my body, penetrating my
very heart with an inconceivable intimacy, bringing me closer to
her than the closest embrace, and yet so subtle that I sensed her
existence in me only as a great, glowing, indeterminate
tenderness, something like the evening light disclosing after the
white passion of the day infinite depths in the colours of the
sky and an unsuspected soul of peace in the protean forms of
life.&nbsp; I had not known such quietness for months; and I
detected in myself an immense fatigue, a longing to remain where
I was without changing my position to the end of time.&nbsp;
Indeed to remain seemed to me a complete solution for all the
problems that life presents&mdash;even as to the very death
itself.</p>
<p>Only the unwelcome reflection that this was impossible made me
get up at last with a sigh of deep grief at the end of the
dream.&nbsp; But I got up without despair.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t
murmur, she didn&rsquo;t stir.&nbsp; There was something august
in the stillness of the room.&nbsp; It was a strange peace which
she shared with me in this unexpected shelter full of disorder in
its neglected splendour.&nbsp; What troubled me was the sudden,
as it were material, consciousness of time passing as water
flows.&nbsp; It seemed to me that it was only the tenacity of my
sentiment that held that woman&rsquo;s body, extended and
tranquil above the flood.&nbsp; But when I ventured at last to
look at her face I saw her flushed, her teeth clenched&mdash;it
was visible&mdash;her nostrils dilated, and in her narrow,
level-glancing eyes a look of inward and frightened
ecstasy.&nbsp; The edges of the fur coat had fallen open and I
was moved to turn away.&nbsp; I had the same impression as on the
evening we parted that something had happened which I did not
understand; only this time I had not touched her at all.&nbsp; I
really didn&rsquo;t understand.&nbsp; At the slightest whisper I
would now have gone out without a murmur, as though that emotion
had given her the right to be obeyed.&nbsp; But there was no
whisper; and for a long time I stood leaning on my arm, looking
into the fire and feeling distinctly between the four walls of
that locked room the unchecked time flow past our two stranded
personalities.</p>
<p>And suddenly she spoke.&nbsp; She spoke in that voice that was
so profoundly moving without ever being sad, a little wistful
perhaps and always the supreme expression of her grace.&nbsp; She
asked as if nothing had happened:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you thinking of, <i>amigo</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I turned about.&nbsp; She was lying on her side, tranquil
above the smooth flow of time, again closely wrapped up in her
fur, her head resting on the old-gold sofa cushion bearing like
everything else in that room the decoratively enlaced letters of
her monogram; her face a little pale now, with the crimson lobe
of her ear under the tawny mist of her loose hair, the lips a
little parted, and her glance of melted sapphire level and
motionless, darkened by fatigue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I think of anything but you?&rdquo; I murmured,
taking a seat near the foot of the couch.&nbsp; &ldquo;Or rather
it isn&rsquo;t thinking, it is more like the consciousness of you
always being present in me, complete to the last hair, to the
faintest shade of expression, and that not only when we are apart
but when we are together, alone, as close as this.&nbsp; I see
you now lying on this couch but that is only the insensible
phantom of the real you that is in me.&nbsp; And it is the easier
for me to feel this because that image which others see and call
by your name&mdash;how am I to know that it is anything else but
an enchanting mist?&nbsp; You have always eluded me except in one
or two moments which seem still more dream-like than the
rest.&nbsp; Since I came into this room you have done nothing to
destroy my conviction of your unreality apart from myself.&nbsp;
You haven&rsquo;t offered me your hand to touch.&nbsp; Is it
because you suspect that apart from me you are but a mere
phantom, and that you fear to put it to the test?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of her hands was under the fur and the other under her
cheek.&nbsp; She made no sound.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t offer to
stir.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t move her eyes, not even after I had
added after waiting for a while,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I expected.&nbsp; You are a cold
illusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled mysteriously, right away from me, straight at the
fire, and that was all.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>
<p>I had a momentary suspicion that I had said something
stupid.&nbsp; Her smile amongst many other things seemed to have
meant that, too.&nbsp; And I answered it with a certain
resignation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know that you are so much
mist.&nbsp; I remember once hanging on to you like a drowning man
. . . But perhaps I had better not speak of this.&nbsp; It
wasn&rsquo;t so very long ago, and you may . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind.&nbsp; Well . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I have kept an impression of great
solidity.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll admit that.&nbsp; A woman of
granite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A doctor once told me that I was made to last for
ever,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But essentially it&rsquo;s the same thing,&rdquo; I
went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;Granite, too, is insensible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I watched her profile against the pillow and there came on her
face an expression I knew well when with an indignation full of
suppressed laughter she used to throw at me the word
&ldquo;Imbecile.&rdquo;&nbsp; I expected it to come, but it
didn&rsquo;t come.&nbsp; I must say, though, that I was swimmy in
my head and now and then had a noise as of the sea in my ears, so
I might not have heard it.&nbsp; The woman of granite, built to
last for ever, continued to look at the glowing logs which made a
sort of fiery ruin on the white pile of ashes.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
will tell you how it is,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;When I have
you before my eyes there is such a projection of my whole being
towards you that I fail to see you distinctly.&nbsp; It was like
that from the beginning.&nbsp; I may say that I never saw you
distinctly till after we had parted and I thought you had gone
from my sight for ever.&nbsp; It was then that you took body in
my imagination and that my mind seized on a definite form of you
for all its adorations&mdash;for its profanations, too.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t imagine me grovelling in spiritual abasement before a
mere image.&nbsp; I got a grip on you that nothing can shake
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak like this,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too much for me.&nbsp; And there is a whole
long night before us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think that I dealt with you
sentimentally enough perhaps?&nbsp; But the sentiment was there;
as clear a flame as ever burned on earth from the most remote
ages before that eternal thing which is in you, which is your
heirloom.&nbsp; And is it my fault that what I had to give was
real flame, and not a mystic&rsquo;s incense?&nbsp; It is neither
your fault nor mine.&nbsp; And now whatever we say to each other
at night or in daylight, that sentiment must be taken for
granted.&nbsp; It will be there on the day I die&mdash;when you
won&rsquo;t be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She continued to look fixedly at the red embers; and from her
lips that hardly moved came the quietest possible whisper:
&ldquo;Nothing would be easier than to die for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; I cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you expect me
perhaps after this to kiss your feet in a transport of gratitude
while I hug the pride of your words to my breast.&nbsp; But as it
happens there is nothing in me but contempt for this sublime
declaration.&nbsp; How dare you offer me this charlatanism of
passion?&nbsp; What has it got to do between you and me who are
the only two beings in the world that may safely say that we have
no need of shams between ourselves?&nbsp; Is it possible that you
are a charlatan at heart?&nbsp; Not from egoism, I admit, but
from some sort of fear.&nbsp; Yet, should you be sincere,
then&mdash;listen well to me&mdash;I would never forgive
you.&nbsp; I would visit your grave every day to curse you for an
evil thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evil thing,&rdquo; she echoed softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you prefer to be a sham&mdash;that one could
forget?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will never forget me,&rdquo; she said in the same
tone at the glowing embers.&nbsp; &ldquo;Evil or good.&nbsp; But,
my dear, I feel neither an evil nor a sham.&nbsp; I have got to
be what I am, and that, <i>amigo</i>, is not so easy; because I
may be simple, but like all those on whom there is no peace I am
not One.&nbsp; No, I am not One!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are all the women in the world,&rdquo; I whispered
bending over her.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t seem to be aware of
anything and only spoke&mdash;always to the glow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I were that I would say: God help them then.&nbsp;
But that would be more appropriate for Therese.&nbsp; For me, I
can only give them my infinite compassion.&nbsp; I have too much
reverence in me to invoke the name of a God of whom clever men
have robbed me a long time ago.&nbsp; How could I help it?&nbsp;
For the talk was clever and&mdash;and I had a mind.&nbsp; And I
am also, as Therese says, naturally sinful.&nbsp; Yes, my dear, I
may be naturally wicked but I am not evil and I could die for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are afraid to
die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; But not for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whole structure of glowing logs fell down, raising a small
turmoil of white ashes and sparks.&nbsp; The tiny crash seemed to
wake her up thoroughly.&nbsp; She turned her head upon the
cushion to look at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very extraordinary thing, we two coming
together like this,&rdquo; she said with conviction.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You coming in without knowing I was here and then telling
me that you can&rsquo;t very well go out of the room.&nbsp; That
sounds funny.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t have been angry if you had
said that you wouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; It would have hurt me.&nbsp;
But nobody ever paid much attention to my feelings.&nbsp; Why do
you smile like this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At a thought.&nbsp; Without any charlatanism of passion
I am able to tell you of something to match your devotion.&nbsp;
I was not afraid for your sake to come within a hair&rsquo;s
breadth of what to all the world would have been a squalid
crime.&nbsp; Note that you and I are persons of honour.&nbsp; And
there might have been a criminal trial at the end of it for
me.&nbsp; Perhaps the scaffold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you say these horrors to make me tremble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you needn&rsquo;t tremble.&nbsp; There shall be no
crime.&nbsp; I need not risk the scaffold, since now you are
safe.&nbsp; But I entered this room meditating resolutely on the
ways of murder, calculating possibilities and chances without the
slightest compunction.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all over now.&nbsp; It
was all over directly I saw you here, but it had been so near
that I shudder yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She must have been very startled because for a time she
couldn&rsquo;t speak.&nbsp; Then in a faint voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;For me!&nbsp; For me!&rdquo; she faltered out
twice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For you&mdash;or for myself?&nbsp; Yet it
couldn&rsquo;t have been selfish.&nbsp; What would it have been
to me that you remained in the world?&nbsp; I never expected to
see you again.&nbsp; I even composed a most beautiful letter of
farewell.&nbsp; Such a letter as no woman had ever
received.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly she shot out a hand towards me.&nbsp; The edges of
the fur cloak fell apart.&nbsp; A wave of the faintest possible
scent floated into my nostrils.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me have it,&rdquo; she said imperiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t have it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all in my
head.&nbsp; No woman will read it.&nbsp; I suspect it was
something that could never have been written.&nbsp; But what a
farewell!&nbsp; And now I suppose we shall say good-bye without
even a handshake.&nbsp; But you are safe!&nbsp; Only I must ask
you not to come out of this room till I tell you you
may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was extremely anxious that Se&ntilde;or Ortega should never
even catch a glimpse of Do&ntilde;a Rita, never guess how near he
had been to her.&nbsp; I was extremely anxious the fellow should
depart for Tolosa and get shot in a ravine; or go to the Devil in
his own way, as long as he lost the track of Do&ntilde;a Rita
completely.&nbsp; He then, probably, would get mad and get shut
up, or else get cured, forget all about it, and devote himself to
his vocation, whatever it was&mdash;keep a shop and grow
fat.&nbsp; All this flashed through my mind in an instant and
while I was still dazzled by those comforting images, the voice
of Do&ntilde;a Rita pulled me up with a jerk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean not out of the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I mean not out of this room,&rdquo; I said with
some embarrassment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&nbsp; Is there something in the house
then?&nbsp; This is most extraordinary!&nbsp; Stay in this
room?&nbsp; And you, too, it seems?&nbsp; Are you also afraid for
yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t even give you an idea how afraid I
was.&nbsp; I am not so much now.&nbsp; But you know very well,
Do&ntilde;a Rita, that I never carry any sort of weapon in my
pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you, then?&rdquo; she asked in a flash
of scorn which bewitched me so completely for an instant that I
couldn&rsquo;t even smile at it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because if I am unconventionalized I am an old
European,&rdquo; I murmured gently.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,
<i>Excellentissima</i>, I shall go through life without as much
as a switch in my hand.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no use you being
angry.&nbsp; Adapting to this great moment some words
you&rsquo;ve heard before: I am like that.&nbsp; Such is my
character!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Rita frankly stared at me&mdash;a most unusual
expression for her to have.&nbsp; Suddenly she sat up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don George,&rdquo; she said with lovely animation,
&ldquo;I insist upon knowing who is in my house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You insist! . . . But Therese says it is <i>her</i>
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had there been anything handy, such as a cigarette box, for
instance, it would have gone sailing through the air spouting
cigarettes as it went.&nbsp; Rosy all over, cheeks, neck,
shoulders, she seemed lighted up softly from inside like a
beautiful transparency.&nbsp; But she didn&rsquo;t raise her
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and Therese have sworn my ruin.&nbsp; If you
don&rsquo;t tell me what you mean I will go outside and shout up
the stairs to make her come down.&nbsp; I know there is no one
but the three of us in the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, three; but not counting my Jacobin.&nbsp; There is
a Jacobin in the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Jac . . .!&nbsp; Oh, George, is this the time to
jest?&rdquo; she began in persuasive tones when a faint but
peculiar noise stilled her lips as though they had been suddenly
frozen.&nbsp; She became quiet all over instantly.&nbsp; I, on
the contrary, made an involuntary movement before I, too, became
as still as death.&nbsp; We strained our ears; but that peculiar
metallic rattle had been so slight and the silence now was so
perfect that it was very difficult to believe one&rsquo;s
senses.&nbsp; Do&ntilde;a Rita looked inquisitively at me.&nbsp;
I gave her a slight nod.&nbsp; We remained looking into each
other&rsquo;s eyes while we listened and listened till the
silence became unbearable.&nbsp; Do&ntilde;a Rita whispered
composedly: &ldquo;Did you hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am asking myself . . . I almost think I
didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shuffle with me.&nbsp; It was a scraping
noise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something fell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something!&nbsp; What thing?&nbsp; What are the things
that fall by themselves?&nbsp; Who is that man of whom you
spoke?&nbsp; Is there a man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt about it whatever.&nbsp; I brought him here
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I have a Jacobin of my own?&nbsp;
Haven&rsquo;t you one, too?&nbsp; But mine is a different problem
from that white-haired humbug of yours.&nbsp; He is a genuine
article.&nbsp; There must be plenty like him about.&nbsp; He has
scores to settle with half a dozen people, he says, and he
clamours for revolutions to give him a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why did you bring him here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;from sudden affection . . .
&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this passed in such low tones that we seemed to make out
the words more by watching each other&rsquo;s lips than through
our sense of hearing.&nbsp; Man is a strange animal.&nbsp; I
didn&rsquo;t care what I said.&nbsp; All I wanted was to keep her
in her pose, excited and still, sitting up with her hair loose,
softly glowing, the dark brown fur making a wonderful contrast
with the white lace on her breast.&nbsp; All I was thinking of
was that she was adorable and too lovely for words!&nbsp; I cared
for nothing but that sublimely aesthetic impression.&nbsp; It
summed up all life, all joy, all poetry!&nbsp; It had a divine
strain.&nbsp; I am certain that I was not in my right mind.&nbsp;
I suppose I was not quite sane.&nbsp; I am convinced that at that
moment of the four people in the house it was Do&ntilde;a Rita
who upon the whole was the most sane.&nbsp; She observed my face
and I am sure she read there something of my inward
exaltation.&nbsp; She knew what to do.&nbsp; In the softest
possible tone and hardly above her breath she commanded:
&ldquo;George, come to yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her gentleness had the effect of evening light.&nbsp; I was
soothed.&nbsp; Her confidence in her own power touched me
profoundly.&nbsp; I suppose my love was too great for madness to
get hold of me.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t say that I passed to a
complete calm, but I became slightly ashamed of myself.&nbsp; I
whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it was not from affection, it was for the love of
you that I brought him here.&nbsp; That imbecile H. was going to
send him to Tolosa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Jacobin!&rdquo; Do&ntilde;a Rita was immensely
surprised, as she might well have been.&nbsp; Then resigned to
the incomprehensible: &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she breathed out,
&ldquo;what did you do with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I put him to bed in the studio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How lovely she was with the effort of close attention depicted
in the turn of her head and in her whole face honestly trying to
approve.&nbsp; &ldquo;And then?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I came in here to face calmly the necessity of
doing away with a human life.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t shirk it for a
moment.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what a short twelvemonth has brought
me to.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t think I am reproaching you, O blind
force!&nbsp; You are justified because you <i>are</i>.&nbsp;
Whatever had to happen you would not even have heard of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Horror darkened her marvellous radiance.&nbsp; Then her face
became utterly blank with the tremendous effort to
understand.&nbsp; Absolute silence reigned in the house.&nbsp; It
seemed to me that everything had been said now that mattered in
the world; and that the world itself had reached its ultimate
stage, had reached its appointed end of an eternal, phantom-like
silence.&nbsp; Suddenly Do&ntilde;a Rita raised a warning
finger.&nbsp; I had heard nothing and shook my head; but she
nodded hers and murmured excitedly,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, in the fencing-room, as before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the same way I answered her: &ldquo;Impossible!&nbsp; The
door is locked and Therese has the key.&rdquo;&nbsp; She asked
then in the most cautious manner,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen Therese to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I confessed without misgiving.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I left her making up the fellow&rsquo;s bed when I came in
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bed of the Jacobin?&rdquo; she said in a peculiar
tone as if she were humouring a lunatic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I had better tell you he is a
Spaniard&mdash;that he seems to know you from early days. . .
.&rdquo;&nbsp; I glanced at her face, it was extremely tense,
apprehensive.&nbsp; For myself I had no longer any doubt as to
the man and I hoped she would reach the correct conclusion
herself.&nbsp; But I believe she was too distracted and worried
to think consecutively.&nbsp; She only seemed to feel some terror
in the air.&nbsp; In very pity I bent down and whispered
carefully near her ear, &ldquo;His name is Ortega.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I expected some effect from that name but I never expected
what happened.&nbsp; With the sudden, free, spontaneous agility
of a young animal she leaped off the sofa, leaving her slippers
behind, and in one bound reached almost the middle of the
room.&nbsp; The vigour, the instinctive precision of that spring,
were something amazing.&nbsp; I just escaped being knocked
over.&nbsp; She landed lightly on her bare feet with a perfect
balance, without the slightest suspicion of swaying in her
instant immobility.&nbsp; It lasted less than a second, then she
spun round distractedly and darted at the first door she could
see.&nbsp; My own agility was just enough to enable me to grip
the back of the fur coat and then catch her round the body before
she could wriggle herself out of the sleeves.&nbsp; She was
muttering all the time, &ldquo;No, no, no.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
abandoned herself to me just for an instant during which I got
her back to the middle of the room.&nbsp; There she attempted to
free herself and I let her go at once.&nbsp; With her face very
close to mine, but apparently not knowing what she was looking at
she repeated again twice, &ldquo;No&mdash;No,&rdquo; with an
intonation which might well have brought dampness to my eyes but
which only made me regret that I didn&rsquo;t kill the honest
Ortega at sight.&nbsp; Suddenly Do&ntilde;a Rita swung round and
seizing her loose hair with both hands started twisting it up
before one of the sumptuous mirrors.&nbsp; The wide fur sleeves
slipped down her white arms.&nbsp; In a brusque movement like a
downward stab she transfixed the whole mass of tawny glints and
sparks with the arrow of gold which she perceived lying there,
before her, on the marble console.&nbsp; Then she sprang away
from the glass muttering feverishly,
&ldquo;Out&mdash;out&mdash;out of this house,&rdquo; and trying
with an awful, senseless stare to dodge past me who had put
myself in her way with open arms.&nbsp; At last I managed to
seize her by the shoulders and in the extremity of my distress I
shook her roughly.&nbsp; If she hadn&rsquo;t quieted down then I
believe my heart would have broken.&nbsp; I spluttered right into
her face: &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let you.&nbsp; Here you
stay.&rdquo;&nbsp; She seemed to recognize me at last, and
suddenly still, perfectly firm on her white feet, she let her
arms fall and, from an abyss of desolation, whispered, &ldquo;O!
George!&nbsp; No!&nbsp; No!&nbsp; Not Ortega.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a passion of mature grief in this tone of
appeal.&nbsp; And yet she remained as touching and helpless as a
distressed child.&nbsp; It had all the simplicity and depth of a
child&rsquo;s emotion.&nbsp; It tugged at one&rsquo;s
heart-strings in the same direct way.&nbsp; But what could one
do?&nbsp; How could one soothe her?&nbsp; It was impossible to
pat her on the head, take her on the knee, give her a chocolate
or show her a picture-book.&nbsp; I found myself absolutely
without resource.&nbsp; Completely at a loss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Ortega.&nbsp; Well, what of it?&rdquo; I whispered
with immense assurance.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>
<p>My brain was in a whirl.&nbsp; I am safe to say that at this
precise moment there was nobody completely sane in the
house.&nbsp; Setting apart Therese and Ortega, both in the grip
of unspeakable passions, all the moral economy of Do&ntilde;a
Rita had gone to pieces.&nbsp; Everything was gone except her
strong sense of life with all its implied menaces.&nbsp; The
woman was a mere chaos of sensations and vitality.&nbsp; I, too,
suffered most from inability to get hold of some fundamental
thought.&nbsp; The one on which I could best build some hopes was
the thought that, of course, Ortega did not know anything.&nbsp;
I whispered this into the ear of Do&ntilde;a Rita, into her
precious, her beautifully shaped ear.</p>
<p>But she shook her head, very much like an inconsolable child
and very much with a child&rsquo;s complete pessimism she
murmured, &ldquo;Therese has told him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words, &ldquo;Oh, nonsense,&rdquo; never passed my lips,
because I could not cheat myself into denying that there had been
a noise; and that the noise was in the fencing-room.&nbsp; I knew
that room.&nbsp; There was nothing there that by the wildest
stretch of imagination could be conceived as falling with that
particular sound.&nbsp; There was a table with a tall strip of
looking-glass above it at one end; but since Blunt took away his
campaigning kit there was no small object of any sort on the
console or anywhere else that could have been jarred off in some
mysterious manner.&nbsp; Along one of the walls there was the
whole complicated apparatus of solid brass pipes, and quite close
to it an enormous bath sunk into the floor.&nbsp; The greatest
part of the room along its whole length was covered with matting
and had nothing else but a long, narrow leather-upholstered bench
fixed to the wall.&nbsp; And that was all.&nbsp; And the door
leading to the studio was locked.&nbsp; And Therese had the
key.&nbsp; And it flashed on my mind, independently of
Do&ntilde;a Rita&rsquo;s pessimism, by the force of personal
conviction, that, of course, Therese would tell him.&nbsp; I
beheld the whole succession of events perfectly connected and
tending to that particular conclusion.&nbsp; Therese would tell
him!&nbsp; I could see the contrasted heads of those two
formidable lunatics close together in a dark mist of whispers
compounded of greed, piety, and jealousy, plotting in a sense of
perfect security as if under the very wing of Providence.&nbsp;
So at least Therese would think.&nbsp; She could not be but under
the impression that (providentially) I had been called out for
the rest of the night.</p>
<p>And now there was one sane person in the house, for I had
regained complete command of my thoughts.&nbsp; Working in a
logical succession of images they showed me at last as clearly as
a picture on a wall, Therese pressing with fervour the key into
the fevered palm of the rich, prestigious, virtuous cousin, so
that he should go and urge his self-sacrificing offer to Rita,
and gain merit before Him whose Eye sees all the actions of
men.&nbsp; And this image of those two with the key in the studio
seemed to me a most monstrous conception of fanaticism, of a
perfectly horrible aberration.&nbsp; For who could mistake the
state that made Jos&eacute; Ortega the figure he was, inspiring
both pity and fear?&nbsp; I could not deny that I understood, not
the full extent but the exact nature of his suffering.&nbsp;
Young as I was I had solved for myself that grotesque and sombre
personality.&nbsp; His contact with me, the personal contact with
(as he thought) one of the actual lovers of that woman who
brought to him as a boy the curse of the gods, had tipped over
the trembling scales.&nbsp; No doubt I was very near death in the
&ldquo;grand salon&rdquo; of the Maison Dor&eacute;e, only that
his torture had gone too far.&nbsp; It seemed to me that I ought
to have heard his very soul scream while we were seated at
supper.&nbsp; But in a moment he had ceased to care for me.&nbsp;
I was nothing.&nbsp; To the crazy exaggeration of his jealousy I
was but one amongst a hundred thousand.&nbsp; What was my
death?&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; All mankind had possessed that
woman.&nbsp; I knew what his wooing of her would be:
Mine&mdash;or Dead.</p>
<p>All this ought to have had the clearness of noon-day, even to
the veriest idiot that ever lived; and Therese was, properly
speaking, exactly that.&nbsp; An idiot.&nbsp; A one-ideaed
creature.&nbsp; Only the idea was complex; therefore it was
impossible really to say what she wasn&rsquo;t capable of.&nbsp;
This was what made her obscure processes so awful.&nbsp; She had
at times the most amazing perceptions.&nbsp; Who could tell where
her simplicity ended and her cunning began?&nbsp; She had also
the faculty of never forgetting any fact bearing upon her one
idea; and I remembered now that the conversation with me about
the will had produced on her an indelible impression of the
Law&rsquo;s surprising justice.&nbsp; Recalling her na&iuml;ve
admiration of the &ldquo;just&rdquo; law that required no
&ldquo;paper&rdquo; from a sister, I saw her casting loose the
raging fate with a sanctimonious air.&nbsp; And Therese would
naturally give the key of the fencing-room to her dear, virtuous,
grateful, disinterested cousin, to that damned soul with delicate
whiskers, because she would think it just possible that Rita
might have locked the door leading front her room into the hall;
whereas there was no earthly reason, not the slightest
likelihood, that she would bother about the other.&nbsp;
Righteousness demanded that the erring sister should be taken
unawares.</p>
<p>All the above is the analysis of one short moment.&nbsp;
Images are to words like light to sound&mdash;incomparably
swifter.&nbsp; And all this was really one flash of light through
my mind.&nbsp; A comforting thought succeeded it: that both doors
were locked and that really there was no danger.</p>
<p>However, there had been that noise&mdash;the why and the how
of it?&nbsp; Of course in the dark he might have fallen into the
bath, but that wouldn&rsquo;t have been a faint noise.&nbsp; It
wouldn&rsquo;t have been a rattle.&nbsp; There was absolutely
nothing he could knock over.&nbsp; He might have dropped a
candle-stick if Therese had left him her own.&nbsp; That was
possible, but then those thick mats&mdash;and then, anyway, why
should he drop it? and, hang it all, why shouldn&rsquo;t he have
gone straight on and tried the door?&nbsp; I had suddenly a
sickening vision of the fellow crouching at the key-hole,
listening, listening, listening, for some movement or sigh of the
sleeper he was ready to tear away from the world, alive or
dead.&nbsp; I had a conviction that he was still listening.&nbsp;
Why?&nbsp; Goodness knows!&nbsp; He may have been only gloating
over the assurance that the night was long and that he had all
these hours to himself.</p>
<p>I was pretty certain that he could have heard nothing of our
whispers, the room was too big for that and the door too
solid.&nbsp; I hadn&rsquo;t the same confidence in the efficiency
of the lock.&nbsp; Still I . . . Guarding my lips with my hand I
urged Do&ntilde;a Rita to go back to the sofa.&nbsp; She
wouldn&rsquo;t answer me and when I got hold of her arm I
discovered that she wouldn&rsquo;t move.&nbsp; She had taken root
in that thick-pile Aubusson carpet; and she was so rigidly still
all over that the brilliant stones in the shaft of the arrow of
gold, with the six candles at the head of the sofa blazing full
on them, emitted no sparkle.</p>
<p>I was extremely anxious that she shouldn&rsquo;t betray
herself.&nbsp; I reasoned, save the mark, as a
psychologist.&nbsp; I had no doubt that the man knew of her being
there; but he only knew it by hearsay.&nbsp; And that was bad
enough.&nbsp; I could not help feeling that if he obtained some
evidence for his senses by any sort of noise, voice, or movement,
his madness would gain strength enough to burst the lock.&nbsp; I
was rather ridiculously worried about the locks.&nbsp; A horrid
mistrust of the whole house possessed me.&nbsp; I saw it in the
light of a deadly trap.&nbsp; I had no weapon, I couldn&rsquo;t
say whether he had one or not.&nbsp; I wasn&rsquo;t afraid of a
struggle as far as I, myself, was concerned, but I was afraid of
it for Do&ntilde;a Rita.&nbsp; To be rolling at her feet, locked
in a literally tooth-and-nail struggle with Ortega would have
been odious.&nbsp; I wanted to spare her feelings, just as I
would have been anxious to save from any contact with mud the
feet of that goatherd of the mountains with a symbolic
face.&nbsp; I looked at her face.&nbsp; For immobility it might
have been a carving.&nbsp; I wished I knew how to deal with that
embodied mystery, to influence it, to manage it.&nbsp; Oh, how I
longed for the gift of authority!&nbsp; In addition, since I had
become completely sane, all my scruples against laying hold of
her had returned.&nbsp; I felt shy and embarrassed.&nbsp; My eyes
were fixed on the bronze handle of the fencing-room door as if it
were something alive.&nbsp; I braced myself up against the moment
when it would move.&nbsp; This was what was going to happen
next.&nbsp; It would move very gently.&nbsp; My heart began to
thump.&nbsp; But I was prepared to keep myself as still as death
and I hoped Do&ntilde;a Rita would have sense enough to do the
same.&nbsp; I stole another glance at her face and at that moment
I heard the word: &ldquo;Beloved!&rdquo; form itself in the still
air of the room, weak, distinct, piteous, like the last request
of the dying.</p>
<p>With great presence of mind I whispered into Do&ntilde;a
Rita&rsquo;s ear: &ldquo;Perfect silence!&rdquo; and was
overjoyed to discover that she had heard me, understood me; that
she even had command over her rigid lips.&nbsp; She answered me
in a breath (our cheeks were nearly touching): &ldquo;Take me out
of this house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I glanced at all her clothing scattered about the room and
hissed forcibly the warning &ldquo;Perfect immobility&rdquo;;
noticing with relief that she didn&rsquo;t offer to move, though
animation was returning to her and her lips had remained parted
in an awful, unintended effect of a smile.&nbsp; And I
don&rsquo;t know whether I was pleased when she, who was not to
be touched, gripped my wrist suddenly.&nbsp; It had the air of
being done on purpose because almost instantly another:
&ldquo;Beloved!&rdquo; louder, more agonized if possible, got
into the room and, yes, went home to my heart.&nbsp; It was
followed without any transition, preparation, or warning, by a
positively bellowed: &ldquo;Speak, perjured beast!&rdquo; which I
felt pass in a thrill right through Do&ntilde;a Rita like an
electric shock, leaving her as motionless as before.</p>
<p>Till he shook the door handle, which he did immediately
afterwards, I wasn&rsquo;t certain through which door he had
spoken.&nbsp; The two doors (in different walls) were rather near
each other.&nbsp; It was as I expected.&nbsp; He was in the
fencing-room, thoroughly aroused, his senses on the alert to
catch the slightest sound.&nbsp; A situation not to be trifled
with.&nbsp; Leaving the room was for us out of the
question.&nbsp; It was quite possible for him to dash round into
the hall before we could get clear of the front door.&nbsp; As to
making a bolt of it upstairs there was the same objection; and to
allow ourselves to be chased all over the empty house by this
maniac would have been mere folly.&nbsp; There was no advantage
in locking ourselves up anywhere upstairs where the original
doors and locks were much lighter.&nbsp; No, true safety was in
absolute stillness and silence, so that even his rage should be
brought to doubt at last and die expended, or choke him before it
died; I didn&rsquo;t care which.</p>
<p>For me to go out and meet him would have been stupid.&nbsp;
Now I was certain that he was armed.&nbsp; I had remembered the
wall in the fencing-room decorated with trophies of cold steel in
all the civilized and savage forms; sheaves of assegais, in the
guise of columns and grouped between them stars and suns of
choppers, swords, knives; from Italy, from Damascus, from
Abyssinia, from the ends of the world.&nbsp; Ortega had only to
make his barbarous choice.&nbsp; I suppose he had got up on the
bench, and fumbling about amongst them must have brought one
down, which, falling, had produced that rattling noise.&nbsp; But
in any case to go to meet him would have been folly, because,
after all, I might have been overpowered (even with bare hands)
and then Do&ntilde;a Rita would have been left utterly
defenceless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will speak,&rdquo; came to me the ghostly, terrified
murmur of her voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take me out of the house before
he begins to speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep still,&rdquo; I whispered.&nbsp; &ldquo;He will
soon get tired of this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I do.&nbsp; Been with him two
hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this she let go my wrist and covered her face with her
hands passionately.&nbsp; When she dropped them she had the look
of one morally crushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He raved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to me.&nbsp; It was all true!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay, but what of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>These ghostly words passed between us hardly louder than
thoughts; but after my last answer she ceased and gave me a
searching stare, then drew in a long breath.&nbsp; The voice on
the other side of the door burst out with an impassioned request
for a little pity, just a little, and went on begging for a few
words, for two words, for one word&mdash;one poor little
word.&nbsp; Then it gave up, then repeated once more, &ldquo;Say
you are there, Rita, Say one word, just one word.&nbsp; Say
&lsquo;yes.&rsquo;&nbsp; Come!&nbsp; Just one little
yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; She only lowered her
eyelids over the anxious glance she had turned on me.</p>
<p>For a minute we could have had the illusion that he had stolen
away, unheard, on the thick mats.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t think
that either of us was deceived.&nbsp; The voice returned,
stammering words without connection, pausing and faltering, till
suddenly steadied it soared into impassioned entreaty, sank to
low, harsh tones, voluble, lofty sometimes and sometimes
abject.&nbsp; When it paused it left us looking profoundly at
each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost comic,&rdquo; I whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; One could laugh,&rdquo; she assented, with a
sort of sinister conviction.&nbsp; Never had I seen her look
exactly like that, for an instant another, an incredible
Rita!&nbsp; &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I laughed at him innumerable
times?&rdquo; she added in a sombre whisper.</p>
<p>He was muttering to himself out there, and unexpectedly
shouted: &ldquo;What?&rdquo; as though he had fancied he had
heard something.&nbsp; He waited a while before he started up
again with a loud: &ldquo;Speak up, Queen of the goats, with your
goat tricks. . .&rdquo;&nbsp; All was still for a time, then came
a most awful bang on the door.&nbsp; He must have stepped back a
pace to hurl himself bodily against the panels.&nbsp; The whole
house seemed to shake.&nbsp; He repeated that performance once
more, and then varied it by a prolonged drumming with his
fists.&nbsp; It <i>was</i> comic.&nbsp; But I felt myself
struggling mentally with an invading gloom as though I were no
longer sure of myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take me out,&rdquo; whispered Do&ntilde;a Rita
feverishly, &ldquo;take me out of this house before it is too
late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will have to stand it,&rdquo; I answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So be it; but then you must go away yourself.&nbsp; Go
now, before it is too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t condescend to answer this.&nbsp; The drumming
on the panels stopped and the absurd thunder of it died out in
the house.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know why precisely then I had the
acute vision of the red mouth of Jos&eacute; Ortega wriggling
with rage between his funny whiskers.&nbsp; He began afresh but
in a tired tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you expect a fellow to forget your tricks, you
wicked little devil?&nbsp; Haven&rsquo;t you ever seen me dodging
about to get a sight of you amongst those pretty gentlemen, on
horseback, like a princess, with pure cheeks like a carved
saint?&nbsp; I wonder I didn&rsquo;t throw stones at you, I
wonder I didn&rsquo;t run after you shouting the tale&mdash;curse
my timidity!&nbsp; But I daresay they knew as much as I
did.&nbsp; More.&nbsp; All the new tricks&mdash;if that were
possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he was making this uproar, Do&ntilde;a Rita put her
fingers in her ears and then suddenly changed her mind and
clapped her hands over my ears.&nbsp; Instinctively I disengaged
my head but she persisted.&nbsp; We had a short tussle without
moving from the spot, and suddenly I had my head free, and there
was complete silence.&nbsp; He had screamed himself out of
breath, but Do&ntilde;a Rita muttering: &ldquo;Too late, too
late,&rdquo; got her hands away from my grip and slipping
altogether out of her fur coat seized some garment lying on a
chair near by (I think it was her skirt), with the intention of
dressing herself, I imagine, and rushing out of the house.&nbsp;
Determined to prevent this, but indeed without thinking very much
what I was doing, I got hold of her arm.&nbsp; That struggle was
silent, too; but I used the least force possible and she managed
to give me an unexpected push.&nbsp; Stepping back to save myself
from falling I overturned the little table, bearing the
six-branched candlestick.&nbsp; It hit the floor, rebounded with
a dull ring on the carpet, and by the time it came to a rest
every single candle was out.&nbsp; He on the other side of the
door naturally heard the noise and greeted it with a triumphant
screech: &ldquo;Aha!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve managed to wake you
up,&rdquo; the very savagery of which had a laughable
effect.&nbsp; I felt the weight of Do&ntilde;a Rita grow on my
arm and thought it best to let her sink on the floor, wishing to
be free in my movements and really afraid that now he had
actually heard a noise he would infallibly burst the door.&nbsp;
But he didn&rsquo;t even thump it.&nbsp; He seemed to have
exhausted himself in that scream.&nbsp; There was no other light
in the room but the darkened glow of the embers and I could
hardly make out amongst the shadows of furniture Do&ntilde;a Rita
sunk on her knees in a penitential and despairing attitude.&nbsp;
Before this collapse I, who had been wrestling desperately with
her a moment before, felt that I dare not touch her.&nbsp; This
emotion, too, I could not understand; this abandonment of
herself, this conscience-stricken humility.&nbsp; A humbly
imploring request to open the door came from the other
side.&nbsp; Ortega kept on repeating: &ldquo;Open the door, open
the door,&rdquo; in such an amazing variety of intonations,
imperative, whining, persuasive, insinuating, and even
unexpectedly jocose, that I really stood there smiling to myself,
yet with a gloomy and uneasy heart.&nbsp; Then he remarked,
parenthetically as it were, &ldquo;Oh, you know how to torment a
man, you brown-skinned, lean, grinning, dishevelled imp,
you.&nbsp; And mark,&rdquo; he expounded further, in a curiously
doctoral tone&mdash;&ldquo;you are in all your limbs hateful:
your eyes are hateful and your mouth is hateful, and your hair is
hateful, and your body is cold and vicious like a snake&mdash;and
altogether you are perdition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This statement was astonishingly deliberate.&nbsp; He drew a
moaning breath after it and uttered in a heart-rending tone,
&ldquo;You know, Rita, that I cannot live without you.&nbsp; I
haven&rsquo;t lived.&nbsp; I am not living now.&nbsp; This
isn&rsquo;t life.&nbsp; Come, Rita, you can&rsquo;t take a
boy&rsquo;s soul away and then let him grow up and go about the
world, poor devil, while you go amongst the rich from one pair of
arms to another, showing all your best tricks.&nbsp; But I will
forgive you if you only open the door,&rdquo; he ended in an
inflated tone: &ldquo;You remember how you swore time after time
to be my wife.&nbsp; You are more fit to be Satan&rsquo;s wife
but I don&rsquo;t mind.&nbsp; You shall be my wife!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sound near the floor made me bend down hastily with a stern:
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t laugh,&rdquo; for in his grotesque, almost
burlesque discourses there seemed to me to be truth, passion, and
horror enough to move a mountain.</p>
<p>Suddenly suspicion seized him out there.&nbsp; With perfectly
farcical unexpectedness he yelled shrilly: &ldquo;Oh, you
deceitful wretch!&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t escape me!&nbsp; I will
have you. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in a manner of speaking he vanished.&nbsp; Of course I
couldn&rsquo;t see him but somehow that was the impression.&nbsp;
I had hardly time to receive it when crash! . . . he was already
at the other door.&nbsp; I suppose he thought that his prey was
escaping him.&nbsp; His swiftness was amazing, almost
inconceivable, more like the effect of a trick or of a
mechanism.&nbsp; The thump on the door was awful as if he had not
been able to stop himself in time.&nbsp; The shock seemed enough
to stun an elephant.&nbsp; It was really funny.&nbsp; And after
the crash there was a moment of silence as if he were recovering
himself.&nbsp; The next thing was a low grunt, and at once he
picked up the thread of his fixed idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will have to be my wife.&nbsp; I have no
shame.&nbsp; You swore you would be and so you will have to
be.&rdquo;&nbsp; Stifled low sounds made me bend down again to
the kneeling form, white in the flush of the dark red glow.&nbsp;
&ldquo;For goodness&rsquo; sake don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I whispered
down.&nbsp; She was struggling with an appalling fit of
merriment, repeating to herself, &ldquo;Yes, every day, for two
months.&nbsp; Sixty times at least, sixty times at
least.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her voice was rising high.&nbsp; She was
struggling against laughter, but when I tried to put my hand over
her lips I felt her face wet with tears.&nbsp; She turned it this
way and that, eluding my hand with repressed low, little
moans.&nbsp; I lost my caution and said, &ldquo;Be quiet,&rdquo;
so sharply as to startle myself (and her, too) into expectant
stillness.</p>
<p>Ortega&rsquo;s voice in the hall asked distinctly:
&ldquo;Eh?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; and then he kept still
on his side listening, but he must have thought that his ears had
deceived him.&nbsp; He was getting tired, too.&nbsp; He was
keeping quiet out there&mdash;resting.&nbsp; Presently he sighed
deeply; then in a harsh melancholy tone he started again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My love, my soul, my life, do speak to me.&nbsp; What
am I that you should take so much trouble to pretend that you
aren&rsquo;t there?&nbsp; Do speak to me,&rdquo; he repeated
tremulously, following this mechanical appeal with a string of
extravagantly endearing names, some of them quite childish, which
all of a sudden stopped dead; and then after a pause there came a
distinct, unutterably weary: &ldquo;What shall I do now?&rdquo;
as though he were speaking to himself.</p>
<p>I shuddered to hear rising from the floor, by my side, a
vibrating, scornful: &ldquo;Do!&nbsp; Why, slink off home looking
over your shoulder as you used to years ago when I had done with
you&mdash;all but the laughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rita,&rdquo; I murmured, appalled.&nbsp; He must have
been struck dumb for a moment.&nbsp; Then, goodness only knows
why, in his dismay or rage he was moved to speak in French with a
most ridiculous accent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you have found your tongue at
last&mdash;<i>Catin</i>!&nbsp; You were that from the
cradle.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you remember how . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Rita sprang to her feet at my side with a loud
cry, &ldquo;No, George, no,&rdquo; which bewildered me
completely.&nbsp; The suddenness, the loudness of it made the
ensuing silence on both sides of the door perfectly awful.&nbsp;
It seemed to me that if I didn&rsquo;t resist with all my might
something in me would die on the instant.&nbsp; In the straight,
falling folds of the night-dress she looked cold like a block of
marble; while I, too, was turned into stone by the terrific
clamour in the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therese, Therese,&rdquo; yelled Ortega.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She has got a man in there.&rdquo;&nbsp; He ran to the
foot of the stairs and screamed again, &ldquo;Therese,
Therese!&nbsp; There is a man with her.&nbsp; A man!&nbsp; Come
down, you miserable, starved peasant, come down and
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where Therese was but I am sure that this
voice reached her, terrible, as if clamouring to heaven, and with
a shrill over-note which made me certain that if she was in bed
the only thing she would think of doing would be to put her head
under the bed-clothes.&nbsp; With a final yell: &ldquo;Come down
and see,&rdquo; he flew back at the door of the room and started
shaking it violently.</p>
<p>It was a double door, very tall, and there must have been a
lot of things loose about its fittings, bolts, latches, and all
those brass applications with broken screws, because it rattled,
it clattered, it jingled; and produced also the sound as of
thunder rolling in the big, empty hall.&nbsp; It was deafening,
distressing, and vaguely alarming as if it could bring the house
down.&nbsp; At the same time the futility of it had, it cannot be
denied, a comic effect.&nbsp; The very magnitude of the racket he
raised was funny.&nbsp; But he couldn&rsquo;t keep up that
violent exertion continuously, and when he stopped to rest we
could hear him shouting to himself in vengeful tones.&nbsp; He
saw it all!&nbsp; He had been decoyed there!&nbsp; (Rattle,
rattle, rattle.)&nbsp; He had been decoyed into that town, he
screamed, getting more and more excited by the noise he made
himself, in order to be exposed to this!&nbsp; (Rattle,
rattle.)&nbsp; By this shameless &ldquo;<i>Catin</i>!
<i>Catin</i>! <i>Catin</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He started at the door again with superhuman vigour.&nbsp;
Behind me I heard Do&ntilde;a Rita laughing softly, statuesque,
turned all dark in the fading glow.&nbsp; I called out to her
quite openly, &ldquo;Do keep your self-control.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
she called back to me in a clear voice: &ldquo;Oh, my dear, will
you ever consent to speak to me after all this?&nbsp; But
don&rsquo;t ask for the impossible.&nbsp; He was born to be
laughed at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t let
yourself go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether Ortega heard us.&nbsp; He was
exerting then his utmost strength of lung against the infamous
plot to expose him to the derision of the fiendish associates of
that obscene woman! . . . Then he began another interlude upon
the door, so sustained and strong that I had the thought that
this was growing absurdly impossible, that either the plaster
would begin to fall off the ceiling or he would drop dead next
moment, out there.</p>
<p>He stopped, uttered a few curses at the door, and seemed
calmer from sheer exhaustion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This story will be all over the world,&rdquo; we heard
him begin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Deceived, decoyed, inveighed, in order to
be made a laughing-stock before the most debased of all mankind,
that woman and her associates.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was really a
meditation.&nbsp; And then he screamed: &ldquo;I will kill you
all.&rdquo;&nbsp; Once more he started worrying the door but it
was a startlingly feeble effort which he abandoned almost at
once.&nbsp; He must have been at the end of his strength.&nbsp;
Do&ntilde;a Rita from the middle of the room asked me recklessly
loud: &ldquo;Tell me!&nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t he born to be laughed
at?&rdquo;&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t answer her.&nbsp; I was so near
the door that I thought I ought to hear him panting there.&nbsp;
He was terrifying, but he was not serious.&nbsp; He was at the
end of his strength, of his breath, of every kind of endurance,
but I did not know it.&nbsp; He was done up, finished; but
perhaps he did not know it himself.&nbsp; How still he was!&nbsp;
Just as I began to wonder at it, I heard him distinctly give a
slap to his forehead.&nbsp; &ldquo;I see it all!&rdquo; he
cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;That miserable, canting peasant-woman
upstairs has arranged it all.&nbsp; No doubt she consulted her
priests.&nbsp; I must regain my self-respect.&nbsp; Let her die
first.&rdquo;&nbsp; I heard him make a dash for the foot of the
stairs.&nbsp; I was appalled; yet to think of Therese being
hoisted with her own petard was like a turn of affairs in a
farce.&nbsp; A very ferocious farce.&nbsp; Instinctively I
unlocked the door.&nbsp; Do&ntilde;a Rita&rsquo;s contralto laugh
rang out loud, bitter, and contemptuous; and I heard
Ortega&rsquo;s distracted screaming as if under torture.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It hurts!&nbsp; It hurts!&nbsp; It hurts!&rdquo;&nbsp; I
hesitated just an instant, half a second, no more, but before I
could open the door wide there was in the hall a short groan and
the sound of a heavy fall.</p>
<p>The sight of Ortega lying on his back at the foot of the
stairs arrested me in the doorway.&nbsp; One of his legs was
drawn up, the other extended fully, his foot very near the
pedestal of the silver statuette holding the feeble and tenacious
gleam which made the shadows so heavy in that hall.&nbsp; One of
his arms lay across his breast.&nbsp; The other arm was extended
full length on the white-and-black pavement with the hand palm
upwards and the fingers rigidly spread out.&nbsp; The shadow of
the lowest step slanted across his face but one whisker and part
of his chin could be made out.&nbsp; He appeared strangely
flattened.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t move at all.&nbsp; He was in his
shirt-sleeves.&nbsp; I felt an extreme distaste for that
sight.&nbsp; The characteristic sound of a key worrying in the
lock stole into my ears.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t locate it but I
didn&rsquo;t attend much to that at first.&nbsp; I was engaged in
watching Se&ntilde;or Ortega.&nbsp; But for his raised leg he
clung so flat to the floor and had taken on himself such a
distorted shape that he might have been the mere shadow of
Se&ntilde;or Ortega.&nbsp; It was rather fascinating to see him
so quiet at the end of all that fury, clamour, passion, and
uproar.&nbsp; Surely there was never anything so still in the
world as this Ortega.&nbsp; I had a bizarre notion that he was
not to be disturbed.</p>
<p>A noise like the rattling of chain links, a small grind and
click exploded in the stillness of the hall and a voice began to
swear in Italian.&nbsp; These surprising sounds were quite
welcome, they recalled me to myself, and I perceived they came
from the front door which seemed pushed a little ajar.&nbsp; Was
somebody trying to get in?&nbsp; I had no objection, I went to
the door and said: &ldquo;Wait a moment, it&rsquo;s on the
chain.&rdquo;&nbsp; The deep voice on the other side said:
&ldquo;What an extraordinary thing,&rdquo; and I assented
mentally.&nbsp; It was extraordinary.&nbsp; The chain was never
put up, but Therese was a thorough sort of person, and on this
night she had put it up to keep no one out except myself.&nbsp;
It was the old Italian and his daughters returning from the ball
who were trying to get in.</p>
<p>Suddenly I became intensely alive to the whole
situation.&nbsp; I bounded back, closed the door of Blunt&rsquo;s
room, and the next moment was speaking to the Italian.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A little patience.&rdquo;&nbsp; My hands trembled but I
managed to take down the chain and as I allowed the door to swing
open a little more I put myself in his way.&nbsp; He was burly,
venerable, a little indignant, and full of thanks.&nbsp; Behind
him his two girls, in short-skirted costumes, white stockings,
and low shoes, their heads powdered and earrings sparkling in
their ears, huddled together behind their father, wrapped up in
their light mantles.&nbsp; One had kept her little black mask on
her face, the other held hers in her hand.</p>
<p>The Italian was surprised at my blocking the way and remarked
pleasantly, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s cold outside, Signor.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I said, &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and added in a hurried whisper:
&ldquo;There is a dead man in the hall.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
didn&rsquo;t say a single word but put me aside a little,
projected his body in for one searching glance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your
daughters,&rdquo; I murmured.&nbsp; He said kindly, &ldquo;<i>Va
bene</i>, <i>va bene</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then to them,
&ldquo;Come in, girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is nothing like dealing with a man who has had a long
past of out-of-the-way experiences.&nbsp; The skill with which he
rounded up and drove the girls across the hall, paternal and
irresistible, venerable and reassuring, was a sight to see.&nbsp;
They had no time for more than one scared look over the
shoulder.&nbsp; He hustled them in and locked them up safely in
their part of the house, then crossed the hall with a quick,
practical stride.&nbsp; When near Se&ntilde;or Ortega he trod
short just in time and said: &ldquo;In truth, blood&rdquo;; then
selecting the place, knelt down by the body in his tall hat and
respectable overcoat, his white beard giving him immense
authority somehow.&nbsp; &ldquo;But&mdash;this man is not
dead,&rdquo; he exclaimed, looking up at me.&nbsp; With profound
sagacity, inherent as it were in his great beard, he never took
the trouble to put any questions to me and seemed certain that I
had nothing to do with the ghastly sight.&nbsp; &ldquo;He managed
to give himself an enormous gash in his side,&rdquo; was his calm
remark.&nbsp; &ldquo;And what a weapon!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
getting it out from under the body.&nbsp; It was an Abyssinian or
Nubian production of a bizarre shape; the clumsiest thing
imaginable, partaking of a sickle and a chopper with a sharp edge
and a pointed end.&nbsp; A mere cruel-looking curio of
inconceivable clumsiness to European eyes.</p>
<p>The old man let it drop with amused disdain.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
had better take hold of his legs,&rdquo; he decided without
appeal.&nbsp; I certainly had no inclination to argue.&nbsp; When
we lifted him up the head of Se&ntilde;or Ortega fell back
desolately, making an awful, defenceless display of his large,
white throat.</p>
<p>We found the lamp burning in the studio and the bed made up on
the couch on which we deposited our burden.&nbsp; My venerable
friend jerked the upper sheet away at once and started tearing it
into strips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may leave him to me,&rdquo; said that efficient
sage, &ldquo;but the doctor is your affair.&nbsp; If you
don&rsquo;t want this business to make a noise you will have to
find a discreet man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was most benevolently interested in all the
proceedings.&nbsp; He remarked with a patriarchal smile as he
tore the sheet noisily: &ldquo;You had better not lose any
time.&rdquo;&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t lose any time.&nbsp; I crammed
into the next hour an astonishing amount of bodily
activity.&nbsp; Without more words I flew out bare-headed into
the last night of Carnival.&nbsp; Luckily I was certain of the
right sort of doctor.&nbsp; He was an iron-grey man of forty and
of a stout habit of body but who was able to put on a
spurt.&nbsp; In the cold, dark, and deserted by-streets, he ran
with earnest, and ponderous footsteps, which echoed loudly in the
cold night air, while I skimmed along the ground a pace or two in
front of him.&nbsp; It was only on arriving at the house that I
perceived that I had left the front door wide open.&nbsp; All the
town, every evil in the world could have entered the
black-and-white hall.&nbsp; But I had no time to meditate upon my
imprudence.&nbsp; The doctor and I worked in silence for nearly
an hour and it was only then while he was washing his hands in
the fencing-room that he asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was he up to, that imbecile?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he was examining this curiosity,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, and it accidentally went off,&rdquo; said the
doctor, looking contemptuously at the Nubian knife I had thrown
on the table.&nbsp; Then while wiping his hands: &ldquo;I would
bet there is a woman somewhere under this; but that of course
does not affect the nature of the wound.&nbsp; I hope this
blood-letting will do him good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing will do him any good,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curious house this,&rdquo; went on the doctor,
&ldquo;It belongs to a curious sort of woman, too.&nbsp; I
happened to see her once or twice.&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder
if she were to raise considerable trouble in the track of her
pretty feet as she goes along.&nbsp; I believe you know her
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curious people in the house, too.&nbsp; There was a
Carlist officer here, a lean, tall, dark man, who couldn&rsquo;t
sleep.&nbsp; He consulted me once.&nbsp; Do you know what became
of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor had finished wiping his hands and flung the towel
far away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Considerable nervous over-strain.&nbsp; Seemed to have
a restless brain.&nbsp; Not a good thing, that.&nbsp; For the
rest a perfect gentleman.&nbsp; And this Spaniard here, do you
know him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough not to care what happens to him,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;except for the trouble he might cause to the Carlist
sympathizers here, should the police get hold of this
affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, he must take his chance in the seclusion of
that conservatory sort of place where you have put him.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll try to find somebody we can trust to look after
him.&nbsp; Meantime, I will leave the case to you.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>
<p>Directly I had shut the door after the doctor I started
shouting for Therese.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come down at once, you
wretched hypocrite,&rdquo; I yelled at the foot of the stairs in
a sort of frenzy as though I had been a second Ortega.&nbsp; Not
even an echo answered me; but all of a sudden a small flame
flickered descending from the upper darkness and Therese appeared
on the first floor landing carrying a lighted candle in front of
a livid, hard face, closed against remorse, compassion, or mercy
by the meanness of her righteousness and of her rapacious
instincts.&nbsp; She was fully dressed in that abominable brown
stuff with motionless folds, and as I watched her coming down
step by step she might have been made of wood.&nbsp; I stepped
back and pointed my finger at the darkness of the passage leading
to the studio.&nbsp; She passed within a foot of me, her pale
eyes staring straight ahead, her face still with disappointment
and fury.&nbsp; Yet it is only my surmise.&nbsp; She might have
been made thus inhuman by the force of an invisible
purpose.&nbsp; I waited a moment, then, stealthily, with extreme
caution, I opened the door of the so-called Captain Blunt&rsquo;s
room.</p>
<p>The glow of embers was all but out.&nbsp; It was cold and dark
in there; but before I closed the door behind me the dim light
from the hall showed me Do&ntilde;a Rita standing on the very
same spot where I had left her, statuesque in her
night-dress.&nbsp; Even after I shut the door she loomed up
enormous, indistinctly rigid and inanimate.&nbsp; I picked up the
candelabra, groped for a candle all over the carpet, found one,
and lighted it.&nbsp; All that time Do&ntilde;a Rita didn&rsquo;t
stir.&nbsp; When I turned towards her she seemed to be slowly
awakening from a trance.&nbsp; She was deathly pale and by
contrast the melted, sapphire-blue of her eyes looked black as
coal.&nbsp; They moved a little in my direction, incurious,
recognizing me slowly.&nbsp; But when they had recognized me
completely she raised her hands and hid her face in them.&nbsp; A
whole minute or more passed.&nbsp; Then I said in a low tone:
&ldquo;Look at me,&rdquo; and she let them fall slowly as if
accepting the inevitable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I make up the fire?&rdquo; . . . I waited.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you hear me?&rdquo;&nbsp; She made no sound and with
the tip of my finger I touched her bare shoulder.&nbsp; But for
its elasticity it might have been frozen.&nbsp; At once I looked
round for the fur coat; it seemed to me that there was not a
moment to lose if she was to be saved, as though we had been lost
on an Arctic plain.&nbsp; I had to put her arms into the sleeves,
myself, one after another.&nbsp; They were cold, lifeless, but
flexible.&nbsp; Then I moved in front of her and buttoned the
thing close round her throat.&nbsp; To do that I had actually to
raise her chin with my finger, and it sank slowly down
again.&nbsp; I buttoned all the other buttons right down to the
ground.&nbsp; It was a very long and splendid fur.&nbsp; Before
rising from my kneeling position I felt her feet.&nbsp; Mere
ice.&nbsp; The intimacy of this sort of attendance helped the
growth of my authority.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lie down,&rdquo; I murmured,
&ldquo;I shall pile on you every blanket I can find here,&rdquo;
but she only shook her head.</p>
<p>Not even in the days when she ran &ldquo;shrill as a cicada
and thin as a match&rdquo; through the chill mists of her native
mountains could she ever have felt so cold, so wretched, and so
desolate.&nbsp; Her very soul, her grave, indignant, and
fantastic soul, seemed to drowse like an exhausted traveller
surrendering himself to the sleep of death.&nbsp; But when I
asked her again to lie down she managed to answer me, &ldquo;Not
in this room.&rdquo;&nbsp; The dumb spell was broken.&nbsp; She
turned her head from side to side, but oh! how cold she
was!&nbsp; It seemed to come out of her, numbing me, too; and the
very diamonds on the arrow of gold sparkled like hoar frost in
the light of the one candle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in this room; not here,&rdquo; she protested, with
that peculiar suavity of tone which made her voice unforgettable,
irresistible, no matter what she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not after all
this!&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t close my eyes in this place.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s full of corruption and ugliness all round, in me, too,
everywhere except in your heart, which has nothing to do where I
breathe.&nbsp; And here you may leave me.&nbsp; But wherever you
go remember that I am not evil, I am not evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t intend to leave you here.&nbsp;
There is my room upstairs.&nbsp; You have been in it
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you have heard of that,&rdquo; she whispered.&nbsp;
The beginning of a wan smile vanished from her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I also think you can&rsquo;t stay in this room; and,
surely, you needn&rsquo;t hesitate . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t matter now.&nbsp; He has
killed me.&nbsp; Rita is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While we exchanged these words I had retrieved the quilted,
blue slippers and had put them on her feet.&nbsp; She was very
tractable.&nbsp; Then taking her by the arm I led her towards the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has killed me,&rdquo; she repeated in a sigh.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The little joy that was in me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has tried to kill himself out there in the
hall,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; She put back like a frightened child
but she couldn&rsquo;t be dragged on as a child can be.</p>
<p>I assured her that the man was no longer there but she only
repeated, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get through the hall.&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t walk.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, flinging the door open and seizing
her suddenly in my arms, &ldquo;if you can&rsquo;t walk then you
shall be carried,&rdquo; and I lifted her from the ground so
abruptly that she could not help catching me round the neck as
any child almost will do instinctively when you pick it up.</p>
<p>I ought really to have put those blue slippers in my
pocket.&nbsp; One dropped off at the bottom of the stairs as I
was stepping over an unpleasant-looking mess on the marble
pavement, and the other was lost a little way up the flight when,
for some reason (perhaps from a sense of insecurity), she began
to struggle.&nbsp; Though I had an odd sense of being engaged in
a sort of nursery adventure she was no child to carry.&nbsp; I
could just do it.&nbsp; But not if she chose to struggle.&nbsp; I
set her down hastily and only supported her round the waist for
the rest of the way.&nbsp; My room, of course, was perfectly dark
but I led her straight to the sofa at once and let her fall on
it.&nbsp; Then as if I had in sober truth rescued her from an
Alpine height or an Arctic floe, I busied myself with nothing but
lighting the gas and starting the fire.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t even
pause to lock my door.&nbsp; All the time I was aware of her
presence behind me, nay, of something deeper and more my
own&mdash;of her existence itself&mdash;of a small blue flame,
blue like her eyes, flickering and clear within her frozen
body.&nbsp; When I turned to her she was sitting very stiff and
upright, with her feet posed hieratically on the carpet and her
head emerging out of the ample fur collar, such as a gem-like
flower above the rim of a dark vase.&nbsp; I tore the blankets
and the pillows off my bed and piled them up in readiness in a
great heap on the floor near the couch.&nbsp; My reason for this
was that the room was large, too large for the fireplace, and the
couch was nearest to the fire.&nbsp; She gave no sign but one of
her wistful attempts at a smile.&nbsp; In a most business-like
way I took the arrow out of her hair and laid it on the centre
table.&nbsp; The tawny mass fell loose at once about her
shoulders and made her look even more desolate than before.&nbsp;
But there was an invincible need of gaiety in her heart.&nbsp;
She said funnily, looking at the arrow sparkling in the gas
light:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; That poor philistinish ornament!&rdquo;</p>
<p>An echo of our early days, not more innocent but so much more
youthful, was in her tone; and we both, as if touched with
poignant regret, looked at each other with enlightened eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;how far away all this
is.&nbsp; And you wouldn&rsquo;t leave even that object behind
when you came last in here.&nbsp; Perhaps it is for that reason
it haunted me&mdash;mostly at night.&nbsp; I dreamed of you
sometimes as a huntress nymph gleaming white through the foliage
and throwing this arrow like a dart straight at my heart.&nbsp;
But it never reached it.&nbsp; It always fell at my feet as I
woke up.&nbsp; The huntress never meant to strike down that
particular quarry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The huntress was wild but she was not evil.&nbsp; And
she was no nymph, but only a goatherd girl.&nbsp; Dream of her no
more, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had the strength of mind to make a sign of assent and busied
myself arranging a couple of pillows at one end of the
sofa.&nbsp; &ldquo;Upon my soul, goatherd, you are not
responsible,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are not!&nbsp; Lay
down that uneasy head,&rdquo; I continued, forcing a half-playful
note into my immense sadness, &ldquo;that has even dreamed of a
crown&mdash;but not for itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She lay down quietly.&nbsp; I covered her up, looked once into
her eyes and felt the restlessness of fatigue over-power me so
that I wanted to stagger out, walk straight before me, stagger on
and on till I dropped.&nbsp; In the end I lost myself in
thought.&nbsp; I woke with a start to her voice saying
positively:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; Not even in this room.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t
close my eyes.&nbsp; Impossible.&nbsp; I have a horror of
myself.&nbsp; That voice in my ears.&nbsp; All true.&nbsp; All
true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was sitting up, two masses of tawny hair fell on each side
of her tense face.&nbsp; I threw away the pillows from which she
had risen and sat down behind her on the couch.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Perhaps like this,&rdquo; I suggested, drawing her head
gently on my breast.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t resist, she
didn&rsquo;t even sigh, she didn&rsquo;t look at me or attempt to
settle herself in any way.&nbsp; It was I who settled her after
taking up a position which I thought I should be able to keep for
hours&mdash;for ages.&nbsp; After a time I grew composed enough
to become aware of the ticking of the clock, even to take
pleasure in it.&nbsp; The beat recorded the moments of her rest,
while I sat, keeping as still as if my life depended upon it with
my eyes fixed idly on the arrow of gold gleaming and glittering
dimly on the table under the lowered gas-jet.&nbsp; And presently
my breathing fell into the quiet rhythm of the sleep which
descended on her at last.&nbsp; My thought was that now nothing
mattered in the world because I had the world safe resting in my
arms&mdash;or was it in my heart?</p>
<p>Suddenly my heart seemed torn in two within my breast and half
of my breath knocked out of me.&nbsp; It was a tumultuous
awakening.&nbsp; The day had come.&nbsp; Do&ntilde;a Rita had
opened her eyes, found herself in my arms, and instantly had
flung herself out of them with one sudden effort.&nbsp; I saw her
already standing in the filtered sunshine of the closed shutters,
with all the childlike horror and shame of that night vibrating
afresh in the awakened body of the woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daylight,&rdquo; she whispered in an appalled
voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look at me, George.&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t face daylight.&nbsp; No&mdash;not with you.&nbsp;
Before we set eyes on each other all that past was like
nothing.&nbsp; I had crushed it all in my new pride.&nbsp;
Nothing could touch the Rita whose hand was kissed by you.&nbsp;
But now!&nbsp; Never in daylight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I sat there stupid with surprise and grief.&nbsp; This was no
longer the adventure of venturesome children in a
nursery-book.&nbsp; A grown man&rsquo;s bitterness, informed,
suspicious, resembling hatred, welled out of my heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this means that you are going to desert me
again?&rdquo; I said with contempt.&nbsp; &ldquo;All right.&nbsp;
I won&rsquo;t throw stones after you . . . Are you going,
then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She lowered her head slowly with a backward gesture of her arm
as if to keep me off, for I had sprung to my feet all at once as
if mad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then go quickly,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are
afraid of living flesh and blood.&nbsp; What are you running
after?&nbsp; Honesty, as you say, or some distinguished carcass
to feed your vanity on?&nbsp; I know how cold you can
be&mdash;and yet live.&nbsp; What have I done to you?&nbsp; You
go to sleep in my arms, wake up and go away.&nbsp; Is it to
impress me?&nbsp; Charlatanism of character, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stepped forward on her bare feet as firm on that floor
which seemed to heave up and down before my eyes as she had ever
been&mdash;goatherd child leaping on the rocks of her native
hills which she was never to see again.&nbsp; I snatched the
arrow of gold from the table and threw it after her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget this thing,&rdquo; I cried,
&ldquo;you would never forgive yourself for leaving it
behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It struck the back of the fur coat and fell on the floor
behind her.&nbsp; She never looked round.&nbsp; She walked to the
door, opened it without haste, and on the landing in the diffused
light from the ground-glass skylight there appeared, rigid, like
an implacable and obscure fate, the awful Therese&mdash;waiting
for her sister.&nbsp; The heavy ends of a big black shawl thrown
over her head hung massively in biblical folds.&nbsp; With a
faint cry of dismay Do&ntilde;a Rita stopped just within my
room.</p>
<p>The two women faced each other for a few moments
silently.&nbsp; Therese spoke first.&nbsp; There was no austerity
in her tone.&nbsp; Her voice was as usual, pertinacious,
unfeeling, with a slight plaint in it; terrible in its unchanged
purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been standing here before this door all
night,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how I
lived through it.&nbsp; I thought I would die a hundred times for
shame.&nbsp; So that&rsquo;s how you are spending your
time?&nbsp; You are worse than shameless.&nbsp; But God may still
forgive you.&nbsp; You have a soul.&nbsp; You are my
sister.&nbsp; I will never abandon you&mdash;till you
die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Do&ntilde;a Rita was heard
wistfully, &ldquo;my soul or this house that you won&rsquo;t
abandon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come out and bow your head in humiliation.&nbsp; I am
your sister and I shall help you to pray to God and all the
Saints.&nbsp; Come away from that poor young gentleman who like
all the others can have nothing but contempt and disgust for you
in his heart.&nbsp; Come and hide your head where no one will
reproach you&mdash;but I, your sister.&nbsp; Come out and beat
your breast: come, poor Sinner, and let me kiss you, for you are
my sister!&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Therese was speaking Do&ntilde;a Rita stepped back a
pace and as the other moved forward still extending the hand of
sisterly love, she slammed the door in Therese&rsquo;s
face.&nbsp; &ldquo;You abominable girl!&rdquo; she cried
fiercely.&nbsp; Then she turned about and walked towards me who
had not moved.&nbsp; I felt hardly alive but for the cruel pain
that possessed my whole being.&nbsp; On the way she stooped to
pick up the arrow of gold and then moved on quicker, holding it
out to me in her open palm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You thought I wouldn&rsquo;t give it to you.&nbsp;
<i>Amigo</i>, I wanted nothing so much as to give it to
you.&nbsp; And now, perhaps&mdash;you will take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not without the woman,&rdquo; I said sombrely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
the courage to deliver myself up to Therese.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Not
even for your sake.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think I have been
miserable enough yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I snatched the arrow out of her hand then and ridiculously
pressed it to my breast; but as I opened my lips she who knew
what was struggling for utterance in my heart cried in a ringing
tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak no words of love, George!&nbsp; Not yet.&nbsp;
Not in this house of ill-luck and falsehood.&nbsp; Not within a
hundred miles of this house, where they came clinging to me all
profaned from the mouth of that man.&nbsp; Haven&rsquo;t you
heard them&mdash;the horrible things?&nbsp; And what can words
have to do between you and me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her hands were stretched out imploringly, I said, childishly
disconcerted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Rita, how can I help using words of love to
you?&nbsp; They come of themselves on my lips!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They come!&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; But I shall seal your lips
with the thing itself,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Like this. .
. &rdquo;</p>
<h2>SECOND NOTE</h2>
<p>The narrative of our man goes on for some six months more,
from this, the last night of the Carnival season up to and beyond
the season of roses.&nbsp; The tone of it is much less of
exultation than might have been expected.&nbsp; Love as is well
known having nothing to do with reason, being insensible to
forebodings and even blind to evidence, the surrender of those
two beings to a precarious bliss has nothing very astonishing in
itself; and its portrayal, as he attempts it, lacks dramatic
interest.&nbsp; The sentimental interest could only have a
fascination for readers themselves actually in love.&nbsp; The
response of a reader depends on the mood of the moment, so much
so that a book may seem extremely interesting when read late at
night, but might appear merely a lot of vapid verbiage in the
morning.&nbsp; My conviction is that the mood in which the
continuation of his story would appear sympathetic is very
rare.&nbsp; This consideration has induced me to suppress
it&mdash;all but the actual facts which round up the previous
events and satisfy such curiosity as might have been aroused by
the foregoing narrative.</p>
<p>It is to be remarked that this period is characterized more by
a deep and joyous tenderness than by sheer passion.&nbsp; All
fierceness of spirit seems to have burnt itself out in their
preliminary hesitations and struggles against each other and
themselves.&nbsp; Whether love in its entirety has, speaking
generally, the same elementary meaning for women as for men, is
very doubtful.&nbsp; Civilization has been at work there.&nbsp;
But the fact is that those two display, in every phase of
discovery and response, an exact accord.&nbsp; Both show
themselves amazingly ingenuous in the practice of
sentiment.&nbsp; I believe that those who know women won&rsquo;t
be surprised to hear me say that she was as new to love as he
was.&nbsp; During their retreat in the region of the Maritime
Alps, in a small house built of dry stones and embowered with
roses, they appear all through to be less like released lovers
than as companions who had found out each other&rsquo;s fitness
in a specially intense way.&nbsp; Upon the whole, I think that
there must be some truth in his insistence of there having always
been something childlike in their relation.&nbsp; In the
unreserved and instant sharing of all thoughts, all impressions,
all sensations, we see the na&iuml;veness of a children&rsquo;s
foolhardy adventure.&nbsp; This unreserved expressed for him the
whole truth of the situation.&nbsp; With her it may have been
different.&nbsp; It might have been assumed; yet nobody is
altogether a comedian; and even comedians themselves have got to
believe in the part they play.&nbsp; Of the two she appears much
the more assured and confident.&nbsp; But if in this she was a
comedienne then it was but a great achievement of her
ineradicable honesty.&nbsp; Having once renounced her honourable
scruples she took good care that he should taste no flavour of
misgivings in the cup.&nbsp; Being older it was she who imparted
its character to the situation.&nbsp; As to the man if he had any
superiority of his own it was simply the superiority of him who
loves with the greater self-surrender.</p>
<p>This is what appears from the pages I have discreetly
suppressed&mdash;partly out of regard for the pages
themselves.&nbsp; In every, even terrestrial, mystery there is as
it were a sacred core.&nbsp; A sustained commentary on love is
not fit for every eye.&nbsp; A universal experience is exactly
the sort of thing which is most difficult to appraise justly in a
particular instance.</p>
<p>How this particular instance affected Rose, who was the only
companion of the two hermits in their rose-embowered hut of
stones, I regret not to be able to report; but I will venture to
say that for reasons on which I need not enlarge, the girl could
not have been very reassured by what she saw.&nbsp; It seems to
me that her devotion could never be appeased; for the conviction
must have been growing on her that, no matter what happened,
Madame could never have any friends.&nbsp; It may be that
Do&ntilde;a Rita had given her a glimpse of the unavoidable end,
and that the girl&rsquo;s tarnished eyes masked a certain amount
of apprehensive, helpless desolation.</p>
<p>What meantime was becoming of the fortune of Henry
All&egrave;gre is another curious question.&nbsp; We have been
told that it was too big to be tied up in a sack and thrown into
the sea.&nbsp; That part of it represented by the fabulous
collections was still being protected by the police.&nbsp; But
for the rest, it may be assumed that its power and significance
were lost to an interested world for something like six
months.&nbsp; What is certain is that the late Henry
All&egrave;gre&rsquo;s man of affairs found himself comparatively
idle.&nbsp; The holiday must have done much good to his harassed
brain.&nbsp; He had received a note from Do&ntilde;a Rita saying
that she had gone into retreat and that she did not mean to send
him her address, not being in the humour to be worried with
letters on any subject whatever.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s enough
for you&rdquo;&mdash;she wrote&mdash;&ldquo;to know that I am
alive.&rdquo;&nbsp; Later, at irregular intervals, he received
scraps of paper bearing the stamps of various post offices and
containing the simple statement: &ldquo;I am still alive,&rdquo;
signed with an enormous, flourished exuberant R.&nbsp; I imagine
Rose had to travel some distances by rail to post those
messages.&nbsp; A thick veil of secrecy had been lowered between
the world and the lovers; yet even this veil turned out not
altogether impenetrable.</p>
<p>He&mdash;it would be convenient to call him Monsieur George to
the end&mdash;shared with Do&ntilde;a Rita her perfect detachment
from all mundane affairs; but he had to make two short visits to
Marseilles.&nbsp; The first was prompted by his loyal affection
for Dominic.&nbsp; He wanted to discover what had happened or was
happening to Dominic and to find out whether he could do
something for that man.&nbsp; But Dominic was not the sort of
person for whom one can do much.&nbsp; Monsieur George did not
even see him.&nbsp; It looked uncommonly as if Dominic&rsquo;s
heart were broken.&nbsp; Monsieur George remained concealed for
twenty-four hours in the very house in which Madame
L&eacute;onore had her caf&eacute;.&nbsp; He spent most of that
time in conversing with Madame L&eacute;onore about
Dominic.&nbsp; She was distressed, but her mind was made
up.&nbsp; That bright-eyed, nonchalant, and passionate woman was
making arrangements to dispose of her caf&eacute; before
departing to join Dominic.&nbsp; She would not say where.&nbsp;
Having ascertained that his assistance was not required Monsieur
George, in his own words, &ldquo;managed to sneak out of the town
without being seen by a single soul that mattered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second occasion was very prosaic and shockingly
incongruous with the super-mundane colouring of these days.&nbsp;
He had neither the fortune of Henry All&egrave;gre nor a man of
affairs of his own.&nbsp; But some rent had to be paid to
somebody for the stone hut and Rose could not go marketing in the
tiny hamlet at the foot of the hill without a little money.&nbsp;
There came a time when Monsieur George had to descend from the
heights of his love in order, in his own words, &ldquo;to get a
supply of cash.&rdquo;&nbsp; As he had disappeared very suddenly
and completely for a time from the eyes of mankind it was
necessary that he should show himself and sign some papers.&nbsp;
That business was transacted in the office of the banker
mentioned in the story.&nbsp; Monsieur George wished to avoid
seeing the man himself but in this he did not succeed.&nbsp; The
interview was short.&nbsp; The banker naturally asked no
questions, made no allusions to persons and events, and
didn&rsquo;t even mention the great Legitimist Principle which
presented to him now no interest whatever.&nbsp; But for the
moment all the world was talking of the Carlist enterprise.&nbsp;
It had collapsed utterly, leaving behind, as usual, a large crop
of recriminations, charges of incompetency and treachery, and a
certain amount of scandalous gossip.&nbsp; The banker (his
wife&rsquo;s salon had been very Carlist indeed) declared that he
had never believed in the success of the cause.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
are well out of it,&rdquo; he remarked with a chilly smile to
Monsieur George.&nbsp; The latter merely observed that he had
been very little &ldquo;in it&rdquo; as a matter of fact, and
that he was quite indifferent to the whole affair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You left a few of your feathers in it,
nevertheless,&rdquo; the banker concluded with a wooden face and
with the curtness of a man who knows.</p>
<p>Monsieur George ought to have taken the very next train out of
the town but he yielded to the temptation to discover what had
happened to the house in the street of the Consuls after he and
Do&ntilde;a Rita had stolen out of it like two scared yet
jubilant children.&nbsp; All he discovered was a strange, fat
woman, a sort of virago, who had, apparently, been put in as a
caretaker by the man of affairs.&nbsp; She made some difficulties
to admit that she had been in charge for the last four months;
ever since the person who was there before had eloped with some
Spaniard who had been lying in the house ill with fever for more
than six weeks.&nbsp; No, she never saw the person.&nbsp; Neither
had she seen the Spaniard.&nbsp; She had only heard the talk of
the street.&nbsp; Of course she didn&rsquo;t know where these
people had gone.&nbsp; She manifested some impatience to get rid
of Monsieur George and even attempted to push him towards the
door.&nbsp; It was, he says, a very funny experience.&nbsp; He
noticed the feeble flame of the gas-jet in the hall still waiting
for extinction in the general collapse of the world.</p>
<p>Then he decided to have a bit of dinner at the Restaurant de
la Gare where he felt pretty certain he would not meet any of his
friends.&nbsp; He could not have asked Madame L&eacute;onore for
hospitality because Madame L&eacute;onore had gone away
already.&nbsp; His acquaintances were not the sort of people
likely to happen casually into a restaurant of that kind and
moreover he took the precaution to seat himself at a small table
so as to face the wall.&nbsp; Yet before long he felt a hand laid
gently on his shoulder, and, looking up, saw one of his
acquaintances, a member of the Royalist club, a young man of a
very cheerful disposition but whose face looked down at him with
a grave and anxious expression.</p>
<p>Monsieur George was far from delighted.&nbsp; His surprise was
extreme when in the course of the first phrases exchanged with
him he learned that this acquaintance had come to the station
with the hope of finding him there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t been seen for some time,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You were perhaps somewhere where the news from
the world couldn&rsquo;t reach you?&nbsp; There have been many
changes amongst our friends and amongst people one used to hear
of so much.&nbsp; There is Madame de Lastaola for instance, who
seems to have vanished from the world which was so much
interested in her.&nbsp; You have no idea where she may be
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monsieur George remarked grumpily that he couldn&rsquo;t
say.</p>
<p>The other tried to appear at ease.&nbsp; Tongues were wagging
about it in Paris.&nbsp; There was a sort of international
financier, a fellow with an Italian name, a shady personality,
who had been looking for her all over Europe and talked in
clubs&mdash;astonishing how such fellows get into the best
clubs&mdash;oh! Azzolati was his name.&nbsp; But perhaps what a
fellow like that said did not matter.&nbsp; The funniest thing
was that there was no man of any position in the world who had
disappeared at the same time.&nbsp; A friend in Paris wrote to
him that a certain well-known journalist had rushed South to
investigate the mystery but had returned no wiser than he
went.</p>
<p>Monsieur George remarked more unamiably than before that he
really could not help all that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the other with extreme gentleness,
&ldquo;only of all the people more or less connected with the
Carlist affair you are the only one that had also disappeared
before the final collapse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Monsieur George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said the other meaningly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You know that all my people like you very much, though
they hold various opinions as to your discretion.&nbsp; Only the
other day Jane, you know my married sister, and I were talking
about you.&nbsp; She was extremely distressed.&nbsp; I assured
her that you must be very far away or very deeply buried
somewhere not to have given a sign of life under this
provocation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Naturally Monsieur George wanted to know what it was all
about; and the other appeared greatly relieved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sure you couldn&rsquo;t have heard.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t want to be indiscreet, I don&rsquo;t want to ask you
where you were.&nbsp; It came to my ears that you had been seen
at the bank to-day and I made a special effort to lay hold of you
before you vanished again; for, after all, we have been always
good friends and all our lot here liked you very much.&nbsp;
Listen.&nbsp; You know a certain Captain Blunt, don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monsieur George owned to knowing Captain Blunt but only very
slightly.&nbsp; His friend then informed him that this Captain
Blunt was apparently well acquainted with Madame de Lastaola, or,
at any rate, pretended to be.&nbsp; He was an honourable man, a
member of a good club, he was very Parisian in a way, and all
this, he continued, made all the worse that of which he was under
the painful necessity of warning Monsieur George.&nbsp; This
Blunt on three distinct occasions when the name of Madame de
Lastaola came up in conversation in a mixed company of men had
expressed his regret that she should have become the prey of a
young adventurer who was exploiting her shamelessly.&nbsp; He
talked like a man certain of his facts and as he mentioned names
. . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; the young man burst out excitedly,
&ldquo;it is your name that he mentions.&nbsp; And in order to
fix the exact personality he always takes care to add that you
are that young fellow who was known as Monsieur George all over
the South amongst the initiated Carlists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How Blunt had got enough information to base that atrocious
calumny upon, Monsieur George couldn&rsquo;t imagine.&nbsp; But
there it was.&nbsp; He kept silent in his indignation till his
friend murmured, &ldquo;I expect you will want him to know that
you are here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Monsieur George, &ldquo;and I hope you
will consent to act for me altogether.&nbsp; First of all, pray,
let him know by wire that I am waiting for him.&nbsp; This will
be enough to fetch him down here, I can assure you.&nbsp; You may
ask him also to bring two friends with him.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
intend this to be an affair for Parisian journalists to write
paragraphs about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; That sort of thing must be stopped at
once,&rdquo; the other admitted.&nbsp; He assented to Monsieur
George&rsquo;s request that the meeting should be arranged for at
his elder brother&rsquo;s country place where the family stayed
very seldom.&nbsp; There was a most convenient walled garden
there.&nbsp; And then Monsieur George caught his train promising
to be back on the fourth day and leaving all further arrangements
to his friend.&nbsp; He prided himself on his impenetrability
before Do&ntilde;a Rita; on the happiness without a shadow of
those four days.&nbsp; However, Do&ntilde;a Rita must have had
the intuition of there being something in the wind, because on
the evening of the very same day on which he left her again on
some pretence or other, she was already ensconced in the house in
the street of the Consuls, with the trustworthy Rose scouting all
over the town to gain information.</p>
<p>Of the proceedings in the walled garden there is no need to
speak in detail.&nbsp; They were conventionally correct, but an
earnestness of purpose which could be felt in the very air lifted
the business above the common run of affairs of honour.&nbsp; One
bit of byplay unnoticed by the seconds, very busy for the moment
with their arrangements, must be mentioned.&nbsp; Disregarding
the severe rules of conduct in such cases Monsieur George
approached his adversary and addressed him directly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Blunt,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the result of
this meeting may go against me.&nbsp; In that case you will
recognize publicly that you were wrong.&nbsp; For you are wrong
and you know it.&nbsp; May I trust your honour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In answer to that appeal Captain Blunt, always correct,
didn&rsquo;t open his lips but only made a little bow.&nbsp; For
the rest he was perfectly ruthless.&nbsp; If he was utterly
incapable of being carried away by love there was nothing
equivocal about his jealousy.&nbsp; Such psychology is not very
rare and really from the point of view of the combat itself one
cannot very well blame him.&nbsp; What happened was this.&nbsp;
Monsieur George fired on the word and, whether luck or skill,
managed to hit Captain Blunt in the upper part of the arm which
was holding the pistol.&nbsp; That gentleman&rsquo;s arm dropped
powerless by his side.&nbsp; But he did not drop his
weapon.&nbsp; There was nothing equivocal about his
determination.&nbsp; With the greatest deliberation he reached
with his left hand for his pistol and taking careful aim shot
Monsieur George through the left side of his breast.&nbsp; One
may imagine the consternation of the four seconds and the
activity of the two surgeons in the confined, drowsy heat of that
walled garden.&nbsp; It was within an easy drive of the town and
as Monsieur George was being conveyed there at a walking pace a
little brougham coming from the opposite direction pulled up at
the side of the road.&nbsp; A thickly veiled woman&rsquo;s head
looked out of the window, took in the state of affairs at a
glance, and called out in a firm voice: &ldquo;Follow my
carriage.&rdquo;&nbsp; The brougham turning round took the
lead.&nbsp; Long before this convoy reached the town another
carriage containing four gentlemen (of whom one was leaning back
languidly with his arm in a sling) whisked past and vanished
ahead in a cloud of white, Proven&ccedil;al dust.&nbsp; And this
is the last appearance of Captain Blunt in Monsieur
George&rsquo;s narrative.&nbsp; Of course he was only told of it
later.&nbsp; At the time he was not in a condition to notice
things.&nbsp; Its interest in his surroundings remained of a hazy
and nightmarish kind for many days together.&nbsp; From time to
time he had the impression that he was in a room strangely
familiar to him, that he had unsatisfactory visions of
Do&ntilde;a Rita, to whom he tried to speak as if nothing had
happened, but that she always put her hand on his mouth to
prevent him and then spoke to him herself in a very strange voice
which sometimes resembled the voice of Rose.&nbsp; The face, too,
sometimes resembled the face of Rose.&nbsp; There were also one
or two men&rsquo;s faces which he seemed to know well enough
though he didn&rsquo;t recall their names.&nbsp; He could have
done so with a slight effort, but it would have been too much
trouble.&nbsp; Then came a time when the hallucinations of
Do&ntilde;a Rita and the faithful Rose left him altogether.&nbsp;
Next came a period, perhaps a year, or perhaps an hour, during
which he seemed to dream all through his past life.&nbsp; He felt
no apprehension, he didn&rsquo;t try to speculate as to the
future.&nbsp; He felt that all possible conclusions were out of
his power, and therefore he was indifferent to everything.&nbsp;
He was like that dream&rsquo;s disinterested spectator who
doesn&rsquo;t know what is going to happen next.&nbsp; Suddenly
for the first time in his life he had the soul-satisfying
consciousness of floating off into deep slumber.</p>
<p>When he woke up after an hour, or a day, or a month, there was
dusk in the room; but he recognized it perfectly.&nbsp; It was
his apartment in Do&ntilde;a Rita&rsquo;s house; those were the
familiar surroundings in which he had so often told himself that
he must either die or go mad.&nbsp; But now he felt perfectly
clear-headed and the full sensation of being alive came all over
him, languidly delicious.&nbsp; The greatest beauty of it was
that there was no need to move.&nbsp; This gave him a sort of
moral satisfaction.&nbsp; Then the first thought independent of
personal sensations came into his head.&nbsp; He wondered when
Therese would come in and begin talking.&nbsp; He saw vaguely a
human figure in the room but that was a man.&nbsp; He was
speaking in a deadened voice which had yet a preternatural
distinctness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the second case I have had in this house, and I
am sure that directly or indirectly it was connected with that
woman.&nbsp; She will go on like this leaving a track behind her
and then some day there will be really a corpse.&nbsp; This young
fellow might have been it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this case, Doctor,&rdquo; said another voice,
&ldquo;one can&rsquo;t blame the woman very much.&nbsp; I assure
you she made a very determined fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&nbsp; That she didn&rsquo;t want to.
. . &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; A very good fight.&nbsp; I heard all about
it.&nbsp; It is easy to blame her, but, as she asked me
despairingly, could she go through life veiled from head to foot
or go out of it altogether into a convent?&nbsp; No, she
isn&rsquo;t guilty.&nbsp; She is simply&mdash;what she
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very much of a woman.&nbsp; Perhaps a little more at
the mercy of contradictory impulses than other women.&nbsp; But
that&rsquo;s not her fault.&nbsp; I really think she has been
very honest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voices sank suddenly to a still lower murmur and presently
the shape of the man went out of the room.&nbsp; Monsieur George
heard distinctly the door open and shut.&nbsp; Then he spoke for
the first time, discovering, with a particular pleasure, that it
was quite easy to speak.&nbsp; He was even under the impression
that he had shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the shadow of the room (he recognized at once the
characteristic outlines of the bulky shape) Mills advanced to the
side of the bed.&nbsp; Do&ntilde;a Rita had telegraphed to him on
the day of the duel and the man of books, leaving his retreat,
had come as fast as boats and trains could carry him South.&nbsp;
For, as he said later to Monsieur George, he had become fully
awake to his part of responsibility.&nbsp; And he added:
&ldquo;It was not of you alone that I was thinking.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But the very first question that Monsieur George put to him
was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long is it since I saw you last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something like ten months,&rdquo; answered Mills&rsquo;
kindly voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; Is Therese outside the door?&nbsp; She stood
there all night, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I heard of it.&nbsp; She is hundreds of miles away
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, ask Rita to come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do that, my dear boy,&rdquo; said Mills
with affectionate gentleness.&nbsp; He hesitated a moment.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do&ntilde;a Rita went away yesterday,&rdquo; he said
softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Went away?&nbsp; Why?&rdquo; asked Monsieur George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, I am thankful to say, your life is no longer
in danger.&nbsp; And I have told you that she is gone because,
strange as it may seem, I believe you can stand this news better
now than later when you get stronger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It must be believed that Mills was right.&nbsp; Monsieur
George fell asleep before he could feel any pang at that
intelligence.&nbsp; A sort of confused surprise was in his mind
but nothing else, and then his eyes closed.&nbsp; The awakening
was another matter.&nbsp; But that, too, Mills had
foreseen.&nbsp; For days he attended the bedside patiently
letting the man in the bed talk to him of Do&ntilde;a Rita but
saying little himself; till one day he was asked pointedly
whether she had ever talked to him openly.&nbsp; And then he said
that she had, on more than one occasion.&nbsp; &ldquo;She told me
amongst other things,&rdquo; Mills said, &ldquo;if this is any
satisfaction to you to know, that till she met you she knew
nothing of love.&nbsp; That you were to her in more senses than
one a complete revelation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then she went away.&nbsp; Ran away from the
revelation,&rdquo; said the man in the bed bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good of being angry?&rdquo;
remonstrated Mills, gently.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know that this world
is not a world for lovers, not even for such lovers as you two
who have nothing to do with the world as it is.&nbsp; No, a world
of lovers would be impossible.&nbsp; It would be a mere ruin of
lives which seem to be meant for something else.&nbsp; What this
something is, I don&rsquo;t know; and I am certain,&rdquo; he
said with playful compassion, &ldquo;that she and you will never
find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few days later they were again talking of Do&ntilde;a Rita
Mills said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before she left the house she gave me that arrow she
used to wear in her hair to hand over to you as a keepsake and
also to prevent you, she said, from dreaming of her.&nbsp; This
message sounds rather cryptic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I understand perfectly,&rdquo; said Monsieur
George.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give me the thing now.&nbsp;
Leave it somewhere where I can find it some day when I am
alone.&nbsp; But when you write to her you may tell her that now
at last&mdash;surer than Mr. Blunt&rsquo;s bullet&mdash;the arrow
has found its mark.&nbsp; There will be no more dreaming.&nbsp;
Tell her.&nbsp; She will understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know where she is,&rdquo; murmured
Mills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but her man of affairs knows. . . . Tell me, Mills,
what will become of her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will be wasted,&rdquo; said Mills sadly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She is a most unfortunate creature.&nbsp; Not even poverty
could save her now.&nbsp; She cannot go back to her goats.&nbsp;
Yet who can tell?&nbsp; She may find something in life.&nbsp; She
may!&nbsp; It won&rsquo;t be love.&nbsp; She has sacrificed that
chance to the integrity of your life&mdash;heroically.&nbsp; Do
you remember telling her once that you meant to live your life
integrally&mdash;oh, you lawless young pedant!&nbsp; Well, she is
gone; but you may be sure that whatever she finds now in life it
will not be peace.&nbsp; You understand me?&nbsp; Not even in a
convent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was supremely lovable,&rdquo; said the wounded man,
speaking of her as if she were lying dead already on his
oppressed heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And elusive,&rdquo; struck in Mills in a low
voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some of them are like that.&nbsp; She will
never change.&nbsp; Amid all the shames and shadows of that life
there will always lie the ray of her perfect honesty.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know about your honesty, but yours will be the easier
lot.&nbsp; You will always have your . . . other love&mdash;you
pig-headed enthusiast of the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let me go to it,&rdquo; cried the
enthusiast.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me go to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went to it as soon as he had strength enough to feel the
crushing weight of his loss (or his gain) fully, and discovered
that he could bear it without flinching.&nbsp; After this
discovery he was fit to face anything.&nbsp; He tells his
correspondent that if he had been more romantic he would never
have looked at any other woman.&nbsp; But on the contrary.&nbsp;
No face worthy of attention escaped him.&nbsp; He looked at them
all; and each reminded him of Do&ntilde;a Rita, either by some
profound resemblance or by the startling force of contrast.</p>
<p>The faithful austerity of the sea protected him from the
rumours that fly on the tongues of men.&nbsp; He never heard of
her.&nbsp; Even the echoes of the sale of the great
All&egrave;gre collection failed to reach him.&nbsp; And that
event must have made noise enough in the world.&nbsp; But he
never heard.&nbsp; He does not know.&nbsp; Then, years later, he
was deprived even of the arrow.&nbsp; It was lost to him in a
stormy catastrophe; and he confesses that next day he stood on a
rocky, wind-assaulted shore, looking at the seas raging over the
very spot of his loss and thought that it was well.&nbsp; It was
not a thing that one could leave behind one for strange
hands&mdash;for the cold eyes of ignorance.&nbsp; Like the old
King of Thule with the gold goblet of his mistress he would have
had to cast it into the sea, before he died.&nbsp; He says he
smiled at the romantic notion.&nbsp; But what else could he have
done with it?</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
