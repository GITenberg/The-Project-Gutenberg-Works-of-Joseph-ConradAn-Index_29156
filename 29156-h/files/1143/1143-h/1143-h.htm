<h2>AUTHOR&rsquo;S NOTE</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether I ought to offer an apology for this collection
which has more to do with life than with letters.&nbsp; Its appeal is
made to orderly minds.&nbsp; This, to be frank about it, is a process
of tidying up, which, from the nature of things, cannot be regarded
as premature.&nbsp; The fact is that I wanted to do it myself because
of a feeling that had nothing to do with the considerations of worthiness
or unworthiness of the small (but unbroken) pieces collected within
the covers of this volume.&nbsp; Of course it may be said that I might
have taken up a broom and used it without saying anything about it.&nbsp;
That, certainly, is one way of tidying up.</p>
<p>But it would have been too much to have expected me to treat all
this matter as removable rubbish.&nbsp; All those things had a place
in my life.&nbsp; Whether any of them deserve to have been picked up
and ranged on the shelf&mdash;this shelf&mdash;I cannot say, and, frankly,
I have not allowed my mind to dwell on the question.&nbsp; I was afraid
of thinking myself into a mood that would hurt my feelings; for those
pieces of writing, whatever may be the comment on their display, appertain
to the character of the man.</p>
<p>And so here they are, dusted, which was but a decent thing to do,
but in no way polished, extending from the year &rsquo;98 to the year
&rsquo;20, a thin array (for such a stretch of time) of really innocent
attitudes: Conrad literary, Conrad political, Conrad reminiscent, Conrad
controversial.&nbsp; Well, yes!&nbsp; A one-man show&mdash;or is it
merely the show of one man?</p>
<p>The only thing that will not be found amongst those Figures and Things
that have passed away, will be Conrad <i>en pantoufles</i>.&nbsp; It
is a constitutional inability.&nbsp; <i>Schlafrock und pantoffeln</i>!&nbsp;
Not that!&nbsp; Never! . . . I don&rsquo;t know whether I dare boast
like a certain South American general who used to say that no emergency
of war or peace had ever found him &ldquo;with his boots off&rdquo;;
but I may say that whenever the various periodicals mentioned in this
book called on me to come out and blow the trumpet of personal opinions
or strike the pensive lute that speaks of the past, I always tried to
pull on my boots first.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t want to do it, God knows!&nbsp;
Their Editors, to whom I beg to offer my thanks here, made me perform
mainly by kindness but partly by bribery.&nbsp; Well, yes!&nbsp; Bribery?&nbsp;
What can you expect?&nbsp; I never pretended to be better than the people
in the next street, or even in the same street.</p>
<p>This volume (including these embarrassed introductory remarks) is
as near as I shall ever come to <i>d&ecirc;shabill&eacute;</i> in public;
and perhaps it will do something to help towards a better vision of
the man, if it gives no more than a partial view of a piece of his back,
a little dusty (after the process of tidying up), a little bowed, and
receding from the world not because of weariness or misanthropy but
for other reasons that cannot be helped: because the leaves fall, the
water flows, the clock ticks with that horrid pitiless solemnity which
you must have observed in the ticking of the hall clock at home.&nbsp;
For reasons like that.&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; It recedes.&nbsp; And this was
the chance to afford one more view of it&mdash;even to my own eyes.</p>
<p>The section within this volume called Letters explains itself, though
I do not pretend to say that it justifies its own existence.&nbsp; It
claims nothing in its defence except the right of speech which I believe
belongs to everybody outside a Trappist monastery.&nbsp; The part I
have ventured, for shortness&rsquo; sake, to call Life, may perhaps
justify itself by the emotional sincerity of the feelings to which the
various papers included under that head owe their origin.&nbsp; And
as they relate to events of which everyone has a date, they are in the
nature of sign-posts pointing out the direction my thoughts were compelled
to take at the various cross-roads.&nbsp; If anybody detects any sort
of consistency in the choice, this will be only proof positive that
wisdom had nothing to do with it.&nbsp; Whether right or wrong, instinct
alone is invariable; a fact which only adds a deeper shade to its inherent
mystery.&nbsp; The appearance of intellectuality these pieces may present
at first sight is merely the result of the arrangement of words.&nbsp;
The logic that may be found there is only the logic of the language.&nbsp;
But I need not labour the point.&nbsp; There will be plenty of people
sagacious enough to perceive the absence of all wisdom from these pages.&nbsp;
But I believe sufficiently in human sympathies to imagine that very
few will question their sincerity.&nbsp; Whatever delusions I may have
suffered from I have had no delusions as to the nature of the facts
commented on here.&nbsp; I may have misjudged their import: but that
is the sort of error for which one may expect a certain amount of toleration.</p>
<p>The only paper of this collection which has never been published
before is the Note on the Polish Problem.&nbsp; It was written at the
request of a friend to be shown privately, and its &ldquo;Protectorate&rdquo;
idea, sprung from a strong sense of the critical nature of the situation,
was shaped by the actual circumstances of the time.&nbsp; The time was
about a month before the entrance of Roumania into the war, and though,
honestly, I had seen already the shadow of coming events I could not
permit my misgivings to enter into and destroy the structure of my plan.&nbsp;
I still believe that there was some sense in it.&nbsp; It may certainly
be charged with the appearance of lack of faith and it lays itself open
to the throwing of many stones; but my object was practical and I had
to consider warily the preconceived notions of the people to whom it
was implicitly addressed, and also their unjustifiable hopes.&nbsp;
They were unjustifiable, but who was to tell them that?&nbsp; I mean
who was wise enough and convincing enough to show them the inanity of
their mental attitude?&nbsp; The whole atmosphere was poisoned with
visions that were not so much false as simply impossible.&nbsp; They
were also the result of vague and unconfessed fears, and that made their
strength.&nbsp; For myself, with a very definite dread in my heart,
I was careful not to allude to their character because I did not want
the Note to be thrown away unread.&nbsp; And then I had to remember
that the impossible has sometimes the trick of coming to pass to the
confusion of minds and often to the crushing of hearts.</p>
<p>Of the other papers I have nothing special to say.&nbsp; They are
what they are, and I am by now too hardened a sinner to feel ashamed
of insignificant indiscretions.&nbsp; And as to their appearance in
this form I claim that indulgence to which all sinners against themselves
are entitled.</p>

<h2>PART I&mdash;LETTERS</h2>
<h3>BOOKS&mdash;1905.</h3>
<h4>I.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;I have not read this author&rsquo;s books, and if I have read
them I have forgotten what they were about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words are reported as having been uttered in our midst not
a hundred years ago, publicly, from the seat of justice, by a civic
magistrate.&nbsp; The words of our municipal rulers have a solemnity
and importance far above the words of other mortals, because our municipal
rulers more than any other variety of our governors and masters represent
the average wisdom, temperament, sense and virtue of the community.&nbsp;
This generalisation, it ought to be promptly said in the interests of
eternal justice (and recent friendship), does not apply to the United
States of America.&nbsp; There, if one may believe the long and helpless
indignations of their daily and weekly Press, the majority of municipal
rulers appear to be thieves of a particularly irrepressible sort.&nbsp;
But this by the way.&nbsp; My concern is with a statement issuing from
the average temperament and the average wisdom of a great and wealthy
community, and uttered by a civic magistrate obviously without fear
and without reproach.</p>
<p>I confess I am pleased with his temper, which is that of prudence.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have not read the books,&rdquo; he says, and immediately he
adds, &ldquo;and if I have read them I have forgotten.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This is excellent caution.&nbsp; And I like his style: it is unartificial
and bears the stamp of manly sincerity.&nbsp; As a reported piece of
prose this declaration is easy to read and not difficult to believe.&nbsp;
Many books have not been read; still more have been forgotten.&nbsp;
As a piece of civic oratory this declaration is strikingly effective.&nbsp;
Calculated to fall in with the bent of the popular mind, so familiar
with all forms of forgetfulness, it has also the power to stir up a
subtle emotion while it starts a train of thought&mdash;and what greater
force can be expected from human speech?&nbsp; But it is in naturalness
that this declaration is perfectly delightful, for there is nothing
more natural than for a grave City Father to forget what the books he
has read once&mdash;long ago&mdash;in his giddy youth maybe&mdash;were
about.</p>
<p>And the books in question are novels, or, at any rate, were written
as novels.&nbsp; I proceed thus cautiously (following my illustrious
example) because being without fear and desiring to remain as far as
possible without reproach, I confess at once that I have not read them.</p>
<p>I have not; and of the million persons or more who are said to have
read them, I never met one yet with the talent of lucid exposition sufficiently
developed to give me a connected account of what they are about.&nbsp;
But they are books, part and parcel of humanity, and as such, in their
ever increasing, jostling multitude, they are worthy of regard, admiration,
and compassion.</p>
<p>Especially of compassion.&nbsp; It has been said a long time ago
that books have their fate.&nbsp; They have, and it is very much like
the destiny of man.&nbsp; They share with us the great incertitude of
ignominy or glory&mdash;of severe justice and senseless persecution&mdash;of
calumny and misunderstanding&mdash;the shame of undeserved success.&nbsp;
Of all the inanimate objects, of all men&rsquo;s creations, books are
the nearest to us, for they contain our very thought, our ambitions,
our indignations, our illusions, our fidelity to truth, and our persistent
leaning towards error.&nbsp; But most of all they resemble us in their
precarious hold on life.&nbsp; A bridge constructed according to the
rules of the art of bridge-building is certain of a long, honourable
and useful career.&nbsp; But a book as good in its way as the bridge
may perish obscurely on the very day of its birth.&nbsp; The art of
their creators is not sufficient to give them more than a moment of
life.&nbsp; Of the books born from the restlessness, the inspiration,
and the vanity of human minds, those that the Muses would love best
lie more than all others under the menace of an early death.&nbsp; Sometimes
their defects will save them.&nbsp; Sometimes a book fair to see may&mdash;to
use a lofty expression&mdash;have no individual soul.&nbsp; Obviously
a book of that sort cannot die.&nbsp; It can only crumble into dust.&nbsp;
But the best of books drawing sustenance from the sympathy and memory
of men have lived on the brink of destruction, for men&rsquo;s memories
are short, and their sympathy is, we must admit, a very fluctuating,
unprincipled emotion.</p>
<p>No secret of eternal life for our books can be found amongst the
formulas of art, any more than for our bodies in a prescribed combination
of drugs.&nbsp; This is not because some books are not worthy of enduring
life, but because the formulas of art are dependent on things variable,
unstable and untrustworthy; on human sympathies, on prejudices, on likes
and dislikes, on the sense of virtue and the sense of propriety, on
beliefs and theories that, indestructible in themselves, always change
their form&mdash;often in the lifetime of one fleeting generation.</p>
<h4>II.</h4>
<p>Of all books, novels, which the Muses should love, make a serious
claim on our compassion.&nbsp; The art of the novelist is simple.&nbsp;
At the same time it is the most elusive of all creative arts, the most
liable to be obscured by the scruples of its servants and votaries,
the one pre-eminently destined to bring trouble to the mind and the
heart of the artist.&nbsp; After all, the creation of a world is not
a small undertaking except perhaps to the divinely gifted.&nbsp; In
truth every novelist must begin by creating for himself a world, great
or little, in which he can honestly believe.&nbsp; This world cannot
be made otherwise than in his own image: it is fated to remain individual
and a little mysterious, and yet it must resemble something already
familiar to the experience, the thoughts and the sensations of his readers.&nbsp;
At the heart of fiction, even the least worthy of the name, some sort
of truth can be found&mdash;if only the truth of a childish theatrical
ardour in the game of life, as in the novels of Dumas the father.&nbsp;
But the fair truth of human delicacy can be found in Mr. Henry James&rsquo;s
novels; and the comical, appalling truth of human rapacity let loose
amongst the spoils of existence lives in the monstrous world created
by Balzac.&nbsp; The pursuit of happiness by means lawful and unlawful,
through resignation or revolt, by the clever manipulation of conventions
or by solemn hanging on to the skirts of the latest scientific theory,
is the only theme that can be legitimately developed by the novelist
who is the chronicler of the adventures of mankind amongst the dangers
of the kingdom of the earth.&nbsp; And the kingdom of this earth itself,
the ground upon which his individualities stand, stumble, or die, must
enter into his scheme of faithful record.&nbsp; To encompass all this
in one harmonious conception is a great feat; and even to attempt it
deliberately with serious intention, not from the senseless prompting
of an ignorant heart, is an honourable ambition.&nbsp; For it requires
some courage to step in calmly where fools may be eager to rush.&nbsp;
As a distinguished and successful French novelist once observed of fiction,
&ldquo;C&rsquo;est un art <i>trop</i> difficile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is natural that the novelist should doubt his ability to cope
with his task.&nbsp; He imagines it more gigantic than it is.&nbsp;
And yet literary creation being only one of the legitimate forms of
human activity has no value but on the condition of not excluding the
fullest recognition of all the more distinct forms of action.&nbsp;
This condition is sometimes forgotten by the man of letters, who often,
especially in his youth, is inclined to lay a claim of exclusive superiority
for his own amongst all the other tasks of the human mind.&nbsp; The
mass of verse and prose may glimmer here and there with the glow of
a divine spark, but in the sum of human effort it has no special importance.&nbsp;
There is no justificative formula for its existence any more than for
any other artistic achievement.&nbsp; With the rest of them it is destined
to be forgotten, without, perhaps, leaving the faintest trace.&nbsp;
Where a novelist has an advantage over the workers in other fields of
thought is in his privilege of freedom&mdash;the freedom of expression
and the freedom of confessing his innermost beliefs&mdash;which should
console him for the hard slavery of the pen.</p>
<h4>III.</h4>
<p>Liberty of imagination should be the most precious possession of
a novelist.&nbsp; To try voluntarily to discover the fettering dogmas
of some romantic, realistic, or naturalistic creed in the free work
of its own inspiration, is a trick worthy of human perverseness which,
after inventing an absurdity, endeavours to find for it a pedigree of
distinguished ancestors.&nbsp; It is a weakness of inferior minds when
it is not the cunning device of those who, uncertain of their talent,
would seek to add lustre to it by the authority of a school.&nbsp; Such,
for instance, are the high priests who have proclaimed Stendhal for
a prophet of Naturalism.&nbsp; But Stendhal himself would have accepted
no limitation of his freedom.&nbsp; Stendhal&rsquo;s mind was of the
first order.&nbsp; His spirit above must be raging with a peculiarly
Stendhalesque scorn and indignation.&nbsp; For the truth is that more
than one kind of intellectual cowardice hides behind the literary formulas.&nbsp;
And Stendhal was pre-eminently courageous.&nbsp; He wrote his two great
novels, which so few people have read, in a spirit of fearless liberty.</p>
<p>It must not be supposed that I claim for the artist in fiction the
freedom of moral Nihilism.&nbsp; I would require from him many acts
of faith of which the first would be the cherishing of an undying hope;
and hope, it will not be contested, implies all the piety of effort
and renunciation.&nbsp; It is the God-sent form of trust in the magic
force and inspiration belonging to the life of this earth.&nbsp; We
are inclined to forget that the way of excellence is in the intellectual,
as distinguished from emotional, humility.&nbsp; What one feels so hopelessly
barren in declared pessimism is just its arrogance.&nbsp; It seems as
if the discovery made by many men at various times that there is much
evil in the world were a source of proud and unholy joy unto some of
the modern writers.&nbsp; That frame of mind is not the proper one in
which to approach seriously the art of fiction.&nbsp; It gives an author&mdash;goodness
only knows why&mdash;an elated sense of his own superiority.&nbsp; And
there is nothing more dangerous than such an elation to that absolute
loyalty towards his feelings and sensations an author should keep hold
of in his most exalted moments of creation.</p>
<p>To be hopeful in an artistic sense it is not necessary to think that
the world is good.&nbsp; It is enough to believe that there is no impossibility
of its being made so.&nbsp; If the flight of imaginative thought may
be allowed to rise superior to many moralities current amongst mankind,
a novelist who would think himself of a superior essence to other men
would miss the first condition of his calling.&nbsp; To have the gift
of words is no such great matter.&nbsp; A man furnished with a long-range
weapon does not become a hunter or a warrior by the mere possession
of a fire-arm; many other qualities of character and temperament are
necessary to make him either one or the other.&nbsp; Of him from whose
armoury of phrases one in a hundred thousand may perhaps hit the far-distant
and elusive mark of art I would ask that in his dealings with mankind
he should be capable of giving a tender recognition to their obscure
virtues.&nbsp; I would not have him impatient with their small failings
and scornful of their errors.&nbsp; I would not have him expect too
much gratitude from that humanity whose fate, as illustrated in individuals,
it is open to him to depict as ridiculous or terrible.&nbsp; I would
wish him to look with a large forgiveness at men&rsquo;s ideas and prejudices,
which are by no means the outcome of malevolence, but depend on their
education, their social status, even their professions.&nbsp; The good
artist should expect no recognition of his toil and no admiration of
his genius, because his toil can with difficulty be appraised and his
genius cannot possibly mean anything to the illiterate who, even from
the dreadful wisdom of their evoked dead, have, so far, culled nothing
but inanities and platitudes.&nbsp; I would wish him to enlarge his
sympathies by patient and loving observation while he grows in mental
power.&nbsp; It is in the impartial practice of life, if anywhere, that
the promise of perfection for his art can be found, rather than in the
absurd formulas trying to prescribe this or that particular method of
technique or conception.&nbsp; Let him mature the strength of his imagination
amongst the things of this earth, which it is his business to cherish
and know, and refrain from calling down his inspiration ready-made from
some heaven of perfections of which he knows nothing.&nbsp; And I would
not grudge him the proud illusion that will come sometimes to a writer:
the illusion that his achievement has almost equalled the greatness
of his dream.&nbsp; For what else could give him the serenity and the
force to hug to his breast as a thing delightful and human, the virtue,
the rectitude and sagacity of his own City, declaring with simple eloquence
through the mouth of a Conscript Father: &ldquo;I have not read this
author&rsquo;s books, and if I have read them I have forgotten . . .&rdquo;</p>
<h3>HENRY JAMES&mdash;AN APPRECIATION&mdash;1905</h3>
<p>The critical faculty hesitates before the magnitude of Mr. Henry
James&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; His books stand on my shelves in a place whose
accessibility proclaims the habit of frequent communion.&nbsp; But not
all his books.&nbsp; There is no collected edition to date, such as
some of &ldquo;our masters&rdquo; have been provided with; no neat rows
of volumes in buckram or half calf, putting forth a hasty claim to completeness,
and conveying to my mind a hint of finality, of a surrender to fate
of that field in which all these victories have been won.&nbsp; Nothing
of the sort has been done for Mr. Henry James&rsquo;s victories in England.</p>
<p>In a world such as ours, so painful with all sorts of wonders, one
would not exhaust oneself in barren marvelling over mere bindings, had
not the fact, or rather the absence of the material fact, prominent
in the case of other men whose writing counts, (for good or evil)&mdash;had
it not been, I say, expressive of a direct truth spiritual and intellectual;
an accident of&mdash;I suppose&mdash;the publishing business acquiring
a symbolic meaning from its negative nature.&nbsp; Because, emphatically,
in the body of Mr. Henry James&rsquo;s work there is no suggestion of
finality, nowhere a hint of surrender, or even of probability of surrender,
to his own victorious achievement in that field where he is a master.&nbsp;
Happily, he will never be able to claim completeness; and, were he to
confess to it in a moment of self-ignorance, he would not be believed
by the very minds for whom such a confession naturally would be meant.&nbsp;
It is impossible to think of Mr. Henry James becoming &ldquo;complete&rdquo;
otherwise than by the brutality of our common fate whose finality is
meaningless&mdash;in the sense of its logic being of a material order,
the logic of a falling stone.</p>
<p>I do not know into what brand of ink Mr. Henry James dips his pen;
indeed, I heard that of late he had been dictating; but I know that
his mind is steeped in the waters flowing from the fountain of intellectual
youth.&nbsp; The thing&mdash;a privilege&mdash;a miracle&mdash;what
you will&mdash;is not quite hidden from the meanest of us who run as
we read.&nbsp; To those who have the grace to stay their feet it is
manifest.&nbsp; After some twenty years of attentive acquaintance with
Mr. Henry James&rsquo;s work, it grows into absolute conviction which,
all personal feeling apart, brings a sense of happiness into one&rsquo;s
artistic existence.&nbsp; If gratitude, as someone defined it, is a
lively sense of favours to come, it becomes very easy to be grateful
to the author of The Ambassadors&mdash;to name the latest of his works.&nbsp;
The favours are sure to come; the spring of that benevolence will never
run dry.&nbsp; The stream of inspiration flows brimful in a predetermined
direction, unaffected by the periods of drought, untroubled in its clearness
by the storms of the land of letters, without languor or violence in
its force, never running back upon itself, opening new visions at every
turn of its course through that richly inhabited country its fertility
has created for our delectation, for our judgment, for our exploring.&nbsp;
It is, in fact, a magic spring.</p>
<p>With this phrase the metaphor of the perennial spring, of the inextinguishable
youth, of running waters, as applied to Mr. Henry James&rsquo;s inspiration,
may be dropped.&nbsp; In its volume and force the body of his work may
be compared rather to a majestic river.&nbsp; All creative art is magic,
is evocation of the unseen in forms persuasive, enlightening, familiar
and surprising, for the edification of mankind, pinned down by the conditions
of its existence to the earnest consideration of the most insignificant
tides of reality.</p>
<p>Action in its essence, the creative art of a writer of fiction may
be compared to rescue work carried out in darkness against cross gusts
of wind swaying the action of a great multitude.&nbsp; It is rescue
work, this snatching of vanishing phases of turbulence, disguised in
fair words, out of the native obscurity into a light where the struggling
forms may be seen, seized upon, endowed with the only possible form
of permanence in this world of relative values&mdash;the permanence
of memory.&nbsp; And the multitude feels it obscurely too; since the
demand of the individual to the artist is, in effect, the cry, &ldquo;Take
me out of myself!&rdquo; meaning really, out of my perishable activity
into the light of imperishable consciousness.&nbsp; But everything is
relative, and the light of consciousness is only enduring, merely the
most enduring of the things of this earth, imperishable only as against
the short-lived work of our industrious hands.</p>
<p>When the last aqueduct shall have crumbled to pieces, the last airship
fallen to the ground, the last blade of grass have died upon a dying
earth, man, indomitable by his training in resistance to misery and
pain, shall set this undiminished light of his eyes against the feeble
glow of the sun.&nbsp; The artistic faculty, of which each of us has
a minute grain, may find its voice in some individual of that last group,
gifted with a power of expression and courageous enough to interpret
the ultimate experience of mankind in terms of his temperament, in terms
of art.&nbsp; I do not mean to say that he would attempt to beguile
the last moments of humanity by an ingenious tale.&nbsp; It would be
too much to expect&mdash;from humanity.&nbsp; I doubt the heroism of
the hearers.&nbsp; As to the heroism of the artist, no doubt is necessary.&nbsp;
There would be on his part no heroism.&nbsp; The artist in his calling
of interpreter creates (the clearest form of demonstration) because
he must.&nbsp; He is so much of a voice that, for him, silence is like
death; and the postulate was, that there is a group alive, clustered
on his threshold to watch the last flicker of light on a black sky,
to hear the last word uttered in the stilled workshop of the earth.&nbsp;
It is safe to affirm that, if anybody, it will be the imaginative man
who would be moved to speak on the eve of that day without to-morrow&mdash;whether
in austere exhortation or in a phrase of sardonic comment, who can guess?</p>
<p>For my own part, from a short and cursory acquaintance with my kind,
I am inclined to think that the last utterance will formulate, strange
as it may appear, some hope now to us utterly inconceivable.&nbsp; For
mankind is delightful in its pride, its assurance, and its indomitable
tenacity.&nbsp; It will sleep on the battlefield among its own dead,
in the manner of an army having won a barren victory.&nbsp; It will
not know when it is beaten.&nbsp; And perhaps it is right in that quality.&nbsp;
The victories are not, perhaps, so barren as it may appear from a purely
strategical, utilitarian point of view.&nbsp; Mr. Henry James seems
to hold that belief.&nbsp; Nobody has rendered better, perhaps, the
tenacity of temper, or known how to drape the robe of spiritual honour
about the drooping form of a victor in a barren strife.&nbsp; And the
honour is always well won; for the struggles Mr. Henry James chronicles
with such subtle and direct insight are, though only personal contests,
desperate in their silence, none the less heroic (in the modern sense)
for the absence of shouted watchwords, clash of arms and sound of trumpets.&nbsp;
Those are adventures in which only choice souls are ever involved.&nbsp;
And Mr. Henry James records them with a fearless and insistent fidelity
to the <i>p&eacute;rip&eacute;ties</i> of the contest, and the feelings
of the combatants.</p>
<p>The fiercest excitements of a romance <i>de cape et d&rsquo;&eacute;p&eacute;e</i>,
the romance of yard-arm and boarding pike so dear to youth, whose knowledge
of action (as of other things) is imperfect and limited, are matched,
for the quickening of our maturer years, by the tasks set, by the difficulties
presented, to the sense of truth, of necessity&mdash;before all, of
conduct&mdash;of Mr. Henry James&rsquo;s men and women.&nbsp; His mankind
is delightful.&nbsp; It is delightful in its tenacity; it refuses to
own itself beaten; it will sleep on the battlefield.&nbsp; These warlike
images come by themselves under the pen; since from the duality of man&rsquo;s
nature and the competition of individuals, the life-history of the earth
must in the last instance be a history of a really very relentless warfare.&nbsp;
Neither his fellows, nor his gods, nor his passions will leave a man
alone.&nbsp; In virtue of these allies and enemies, he holds his precarious
dominion, he possesses his fleeting significance; and it is this relation
in all its manifestations, great and little, superficial or profound,
and this relation alone, that is commented upon, interpreted, demonstrated
by the art of the novelist in the only possible way in which the task
can be performed: by the independent creation of circumstance and character,
achieved against all the difficulties of expression, in an imaginative
effort finding its inspiration from the reality of forms and sensations.&nbsp;
That a sacrifice must be made, that something has to be given up, is
the truth engraved in the innermost recesses of the fair temple built
for our edification by the masters of fiction.&nbsp; There is no other
secret behind the curtain.&nbsp; All adventure, all love, every success
is resumed in the supreme energy of an act of renunciation.&nbsp; It
is the uttermost limit of our power; it is the most potent and effective
force at our disposal on which rest the labours of a solitary man in
his study, the rock on which have been built commonwealths whose might
casts a dwarfing shadow upon two oceans.&nbsp; Like a natural force
which is obscured as much as illuminated by the multiplicity of phenomena,
the power of renunciation is obscured by the mass of weaknesses, vacillations,
secondary motives and false steps and compromises which make up the
sum of our activity.&nbsp; But no man or woman worthy of the name can
pretend to anything more, to anything greater.&nbsp; And Mr. Henry James&rsquo;s
men and women are worthy of the name, within the limits his art, so
clear, so sure of itself, has drawn round their activities.&nbsp; He
would be the last to claim for them Titanic proportions.&nbsp; The earth
itself has grown smaller in the course of ages.&nbsp; But in every sphere
of human perplexities and emotions, there are more greatnesses than
one&mdash;not counting here the greatness of the artist himself.&nbsp;
Wherever he stands, at the beginning or the end of things, a man has
to sacrifice his gods to his passions, or his passions to his gods.&nbsp;
That is the problem, great enough, in all truth, if approached in the
spirit of sincerity and knowledge.</p>
<p>In one of his critical studies, published some fifteen years ago,
Mr. Henry James claims for the novelist the standing of the historian
as the only adequate one, as for himself and before his audience.&nbsp;
I think that the claim cannot be contested, and that the position is
unassailable.&nbsp; Fiction is history, human history, or it is nothing.&nbsp;
But it is also more than that; it stands on firmer ground, being based
on the reality of forms and the observation of social phenomena, whereas
history is based on documents, and the reading of print and handwriting&mdash;on
second-hand impression.&nbsp; Thus fiction is nearer truth.&nbsp; But
let that pass.&nbsp; A historian may be an artist too, and a novelist
is a historian, the preserver, the keeper, the expounder, of human experience.&nbsp;
As is meet for a man of his descent and tradition, Mr. Henry James is
the historian of fine consciences.</p>
<p>Of course, this is a general statement; but I don&rsquo;t think its
truth will be, or can be questioned.&nbsp; Its fault is that it leaves
so much out; and, besides, Mr. Henry James is much too considerable
to be put into the nutshell of a phrase.&nbsp; The fact remains that
he has made his choice, and that his choice is justified up to the hilt
by the success of his art.&nbsp; He has taken for himself the greater
part.&nbsp; The range of a fine conscience covers more good and evil
than the range of conscience which may be called, roughly, not fine;
a conscience, less troubled by the nice discrimination of shades of
conduct.&nbsp; A fine conscience is more concerned with essentials;
its triumphs are more perfect, if less profitable, in a worldly sense.&nbsp;
There is, in short, more truth in its working for a historian to detect
and to show.&nbsp; It is a thing of infinite complication and suggestion.&nbsp;
None of these escapes the art of Mr. Henry James.&nbsp; He has mastered
the country, his domain, not wild indeed, but full of romantic glimpses,
of deep shadows and sunny places.&nbsp; There are no secrets left within
his range.&nbsp; He has disclosed them as they should be disclosed&mdash;that
is, beautifully.&nbsp; And, indeed, ugliness has but little place in
this world of his creation.&nbsp; Yet, it is always felt in the truthfulness
of his art; it is there, it surrounds the scene, it presses close upon
it.&nbsp; It is made visible, tangible, in the struggles, in the contacts
of the fine consciences, in their perplexities, in the sophism of their
mistakes.&nbsp; For a fine conscience is naturally a virtuous one.&nbsp;
What is natural about it is just its fineness, an abiding sense of the
intangible, ever-present, right.&nbsp; It is most visible in their ultimate
triumph, in their emergence from miracle, through an energetic act of
renunciation.&nbsp; Energetic, not violent: the distinction is wide,
enormous, like that between substance and shadow.</p>
<p>Through it all Mr. Henry James keeps a firm hold of the substance,
of what is worth having, of what is worth holding.&nbsp; The contrary
opinion has been, if not absolutely affirmed, then at least implied,
with some frequency.&nbsp; To most of us, living willingly in a sort
of intellectual moonlight, in the faintly reflected light of truth,
the shadows so firmly renounced by Mr. Henry James&rsquo;s men and women,
stand out endowed with extraordinary value, with a value so extraordinary
that their rejection offends, by its uncalled-for scrupulousness, those
business-like instincts which a careful Providence has implanted in
our breasts.&nbsp; And, apart from that just cause of discontent, it
is obvious that a solution by rejection must always present a certain
lack of finality, especially startling when contrasted with the usual
methods of solution by rewards and punishments, by crowned love, by
fortune, by a broken leg or a sudden death.&nbsp; Why the reading public
which, as a body, has never laid upon a story-teller the command to
be an artist, should demand from him this sham of Divine Omnipotence,
is utterly incomprehensible.&nbsp; But so it is; and these solutions
are legitimate inasmuch as they satisfy the desire for finality, for
which our hearts yearn with a longing greater than the longing for the
loaves and fishes of this earth.&nbsp; Perhaps the only true desire
of mankind, coming thus to light in its hours of leisure, is to be set
at rest.&nbsp; One is never set at rest by Mr. Henry James&rsquo;s novels.&nbsp;
His books end as an episode in life ends.&nbsp; You remain with the
sense of the life still going on; and even the subtle presence of the
dead is felt in that silence that comes upon the artist-creation when
the last word has been read.&nbsp; It is eminently satisfying, but it
is not final.&nbsp; Mr. Henry James, great artist and faithful historian,
never attempts the impossible.</p>
<h3>ALPHONSE DAUDET&mdash;1898</h3>
<p>It is sweet to talk decorously of the dead who are part of our past,
our indisputable possession.&nbsp; One must admit regretfully that to-day
is but a scramble, that to-morrow may never come; it is only the precious
yesterday that cannot be taken away from us.&nbsp; A gift from the dead,
great and little, it makes life supportable, it almost makes one believe
in a benevolent scheme of creation.&nbsp; And some kind of belief is
very necessary.&nbsp; But the real knowledge of matters infinitely more
profound than any conceivable scheme of creation is with the dead alone.&nbsp;
That is why our talk about them should be as decorous as their silence.&nbsp;
Their generosity and their discretion deserve nothing less at our hands;
and they, who belong already to the unchangeable, would probably disdain
to claim more than this from a mankind that changes its loves and its
hates about every twenty-five years&mdash;at the coming of every new
and wiser generation.</p>
<p>One of the most generous of the dead is Daudet, who, with a prodigality
approaching magnificence, gave himself up to us without reserve in his
work, with all his qualities and all his faults.&nbsp; Neither his qualities
nor his faults were great, though they were by no means imperceptible.&nbsp;
It is only his generosity that is out of the common.&nbsp; What strikes
one most in his work is the disinterestedness of the toiler.&nbsp; With
more talent than many bigger men, he did not preach about himself, he
did not attempt to persuade mankind into a belief of his own greatness.&nbsp;
He never posed as a scientist or as a seer, not even as a prophet; and
he neglected his interests to the point of never propounding a theory
for the purpose of giving a tremendous significance to his art, alone
of all things, in a world that, by some strange oversight, has not been
supplied with an obvious meaning.&nbsp; Neither did he affect a passive
attitude before the spectacle of life, an attitude which in gods&mdash;and
in a rare mortal here and there&mdash;may appear godlike, but assumed
by some men, causes one, very unwillingly, to think of the melancholy
quietude of an ape.&nbsp; He was not the wearisome expounder of this
or that theory, here to-day and spurned to-morrow.&nbsp; He was not
a great artist, he was not an artist at all, if you like&mdash;but he
was Alphonse Daudet, a man as naively clear, honest, and vibrating as
the sunshine of his native land; that regrettably undiscriminating sunshine
which matures grapes and pumpkins alike, and cannot, of course, obtain
the commendation of the very select who look at life from under a parasol.</p>
<p>Naturally, being a man from the South, he had a rather outspoken
belief in himself, but his small distinction, worth many a greater,
was in not being in bondage to some vanishing creed.&nbsp; He was a
worker who could not compel the admiration of the few, but who deserved
the affection of the many; and he may be spoken of with tenderness and
regret, for he is not immortal&mdash;he is only dead.&nbsp; During his
life the simple man whose business it ought to have been to climb, in
the name of Art, some elevation or other, was content to remain below,
on the plain, amongst his creations, and take an eager part in those
disasters, weaknesses, and joys which are tragic enough in their droll
way, but are by no means so momentous and profound as some writers&mdash;probably
for the sake of Art&mdash;would like to make us believe.&nbsp; There
is, when one thinks of it, a considerable want of candour in the august
view of life.&nbsp; Without doubt a cautious reticence on the subject,
or even a delicately false suggestion thrown out in that direction is,
in a way, praiseworthy, since it helps to uphold the dignity of man&mdash;a
matter of great importance, as anyone can see; still one cannot help
feeling that a certain amount of sincerity would not be wholly blamable.&nbsp;
To state, then, with studied moderation a belief that in unfortunate
moments of lucidity is irresistibly borne in upon most of us&mdash;the
blind agitation caused mostly by hunger and complicated by love and
ferocity does not deserve either by its beauty, or its morality, or
its possible results, the artistic fuss made over it.&nbsp; It may be
consoling&mdash;for human folly is very <i>bizarre</i>&mdash;but it
is scarcely honest to shout at those who struggle drowning in an insignificant
pool: You are indeed admirable and great to be the victims of such a
profound, of such a terrible ocean!</p>
<p>And Daudet was honest; perhaps because he knew no better&mdash;but
he was very honest.&nbsp; If he saw only the surface of things it is
for the reason that most things have nothing but a surface.&nbsp; He
did not pretend&mdash;perhaps because he did not know how&mdash;he did
not pretend to see any depths in a life that is only a film of unsteady
appearances stretched over regions deep indeed, but which have nothing
to do with the half-truths, half-thoughts, and whole illusions of existence.&nbsp;
The road to these distant regions does not lie through the domain of
Art or the domain of Science where well-known voices quarrel noisily
in a misty emptiness; it is a path of toilsome silence upon which travel
men simple and unknown, with closed lips, or, maybe, whispering their
pain softly&mdash;only to themselves.</p>
<p>But Daudet did not whisper; he spoke loudly, with animation, with
a clear felicity of tone&mdash;as a bird sings.&nbsp; He saw life around
him with extreme clearness, and he felt it as it is&mdash;thinner than
air and more elusive than a flash of lightning.&nbsp; He hastened to
offer it his compassion, his indignation, his wonder, his sympathy,
without giving a moment of thought to the momentous issues that are
supposed to lurk in the logic of such sentiments.&nbsp; He tolerated
the little foibles, the small ruffianisms, the grave mistakes; the only
thing he distinctly would not forgive was hardness of heart.&nbsp; This
unpractical attitude would have been fatal to a better man, but his
readers have forgiven him.&nbsp; Withal he is chivalrous to exiled queens
and deformed sempstresses, he is pityingly tender to broken-down actors,
to ruined gentlemen, to stupid Academicians; he is glad of the joys
of the commonplace people in a commonplace way&mdash;and he never makes
a secret of all this.&nbsp; No, the man was not an artist.&nbsp; What
if his creations are illumined by the sunshine of his temperament so
vividly that they stand before us infinitely more real than the dingy
illusions surrounding our everyday existence?&nbsp; The misguided man
is for ever pottering amongst them, lifting up his voice, dotting his
i&rsquo;s in the wrong places.&nbsp; He takes Tartarin by the arm, he
does not conceal his interest in the Nabob&rsquo;s cheques, his sympathy
for an honest Academician <i>plus b&ecirc;te que nature</i>, his hate
for an architect <i>plus mauvais que la gale</i>; he is in the thick
of it all.&nbsp; He feels with the Duc de Mora and with Felicia Ruys&mdash;and
he lets you see it.&nbsp; He does not sit on a pedestal in the hieratic
and imbecile pose of some cheap god whose greatness consists in being
too stupid to care.&nbsp; He cares immensely for his Nabobs, his kings,
his book-keepers, his Colettes, and his Saphos.&nbsp; He vibrates together
with his universe, and with lamentable simplicity follows M. de Montpavon
on that last walk along the Boulevards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur de Montpavon marche &agrave; la mort,&rdquo; and
the creator of that unlucky <i>gentilhomme</i> follows with stealthy
footsteps, with wide eyes, with an impressively pointing finger.&nbsp;
And who wouldn&rsquo;t look?&nbsp; But it is hard; it is sometimes very
hard to forgive him the dotted i&rsquo;s, the pointing finger, this
making plain of obvious mysteries.&nbsp; &ldquo;Monsieur de Montpavon
marche &agrave; la mort,&rdquo; and presently, on the crowded pavement,
takes off his hat with punctilious courtesy to the doctor&rsquo;s wife,
who, elegant and unhappy, is bound on the same pilgrimage.&nbsp; This
is too much!&nbsp; We feel we cannot forgive him such meetings, the
constant whisper of his presence.&nbsp; We feel we cannot, till suddenly
the very <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> of it all touches us with the revealed
suggestion of a truth.&nbsp; Then we see that the man is not false;
all this is done in transparent good faith.&nbsp; The man is not melodramatic;
he is only picturesque.&nbsp; He may not be an artist, but he comes
as near the truth as some of the greatest.&nbsp; His creations are seen;
you can look into their very eyes, and these are as thoughtless as the
eyes of any wise generation that has in its hands the fame of writers.&nbsp;
Yes, they are <i>seen</i>, and the man who is not an artist is seen
also commiserating, indignant, joyous, human and alive in their very
midst.&nbsp; Inevitably they <i>marchent &agrave; la mort</i>&mdash;and
they are very near the truth of our common destiny: their fate is poignant,
it is intensely interesting, and of not the slightest consequence.</p>
<h3>GUY DE MAUPASSANT&mdash;1904 <a name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1">{1}</a></h3>
<p>To introduce Maupassant to English readers with apologetic explanations
as though his art were recondite and the tendency of his work immoral
would be a gratuitous impertinence.</p>
<p>Maupassant&rsquo;s conception of his art is such as one would expect
from a practical and resolute mind; but in the consummate simplicity
of his technique it ceases to be perceptible.&nbsp; This is one of its
greatest qualities, and like all the great virtues it is based primarily
on self-denial.</p>
<p>To pronounce a judgment upon the general tendency of an author is
a difficult task.&nbsp; One could not depend upon reason alone, nor
yet trust solely to one&rsquo;s emotions.&nbsp; Used together, they
would in many cases traverse each other, because emotions have their
own unanswerable logic.&nbsp; Our capacity for emotion is limited, and
the field of our intelligence is restricted.&nbsp; Responsiveness to
every feeling, combined with the penetration of every intellectual subterfuge,
would end, not in judgment, but in universal absolution.&nbsp; <i>Tout
comprendre c&rsquo;est tout pardonner</i>.&nbsp; And in this benevolent
neutrality towards the warring errors of human nature all light would
go out from art and from life.</p>
<p>We are at liberty then to quarrel with Maupassant&rsquo;s attitude
towards our world in which, like the rest of us, he has that share which
his senses are able to give him.&nbsp; But we need not quarrel with
him violently.&nbsp; If our feelings (which are tender) happen to be
hurt because his talent is not exercised for the praise and consolation
of mankind, our intelligence (which is great) should let us see that
he is a very splendid sinner, like all those who in this valley of compromises
err by over-devotion to the truth that is in them.&nbsp; His determinism,
barren of praise, blame and consolation, has all the merit of his conscientious
art.&nbsp; The worth of every conviction consists precisely in the steadfastness
with which it is held.</p>
<p>Except for his philosophy, which in the case of so consummate an
artist does not matter (unless to the solemn and naive mind), Maupassant
of all writers of fiction demands least forgiveness from his readers.&nbsp;
He does not require forgiveness because he is never dull.</p>
<p>The interest of a reader in a work of imagination is either ethical
or that of simple curiosity.&nbsp; Both are perfectly legitimate, since
there is both a moral and an excitement to be found in a faithful rendering
of life.&nbsp; And in Maupassant&rsquo;s work there is the interest
of curiosity and the moral of a point of view consistently preserved
and never obtruded for the end of personal gratification.&nbsp; The
spectacle of this immense talent served by exceptional faculties and
triumphing over the most thankless subjects by an unswerving singleness
of purpose is in itself an admirable lesson in the power of artistic
honesty, one may say of artistic virtue.&nbsp; The inherent greatness
of the man consists in this, that he will let none of the fascinations
that beset a writer working in loneliness turn him away from the straight
path, from the vouchsafed vision of excellence.&nbsp; He will not be
led into perdition by the seductions of sentiment, of eloquence, of
humour, of pathos; of all that splendid pageant of faults that pass
between the writer and his probity on the blank sheet of paper, like
the glittering cort&egrave;ge of deadly sins before the austere anchorite
in the desert air of Theba&iuml;de.&nbsp; This is not to say that Maupassant&rsquo;s
austerity has never faltered; but the fact remains that no tempting
demon has ever succeeded in hurling him down from his high, if narrow,
pedestal.</p>
<p>It is the austerity of his talent, of course, that is in question.&nbsp;
Let the discriminating reader, who at times may well spare a moment
or two to the consideration and enjoyment of artistic excellence, be
asked to reflect a little upon the texture of two stories included in
this volume: &ldquo;A Piece of String,&rdquo; and &ldquo;A Sale.&rdquo;&nbsp;
How many openings the last offers for the gratuitous display of the
author&rsquo;s wit or clever buffoonery, the first for an unmeasured
display of sentiment!&nbsp; And both sentiment and buffoonery could
have been made very good too, in a way accessible to the meanest intelligence,
at the cost of truth and honesty.&nbsp; Here it is where Maupassant&rsquo;s
austerity comes in.&nbsp; He refrains from setting his cleverness against
the eloquence of the facts.&nbsp; There is humour and pathos in these
stories; but such is the greatness of his talent, the refinement of
his artistic conscience, that all his high qualities appear inherent
in the very things of which he speaks, as if they had been altogether
independent of his presentation.&nbsp; Facts, and again facts are his
unique concern.&nbsp; That is why he is not always properly understood.&nbsp;
His facts are so perfectly rendered that, like the actualities of life
itself, they demand from the reader the faculty of observation which
is rare, the power of appreciation which is generally wanting in most
of us who are guided mainly by empty phrases requiring no effort, demanding
from us no qualities except a vague susceptibility to emotion.&nbsp;
Nobody has ever gained the vast applause of a crowd by the simple and
clear exposition of vital facts.&nbsp; Words alone strung upon a convention
have fascinated us as worthless glass beads strung on a thread have
charmed at all times our brothers the unsophisticated savages of the
islands.&nbsp; Now, Maupassant, of whom it has been said that he is
the master of the <i>mot juste</i>, has never been a dealer in words.&nbsp;
His wares have been, not glass beads, but polished gems; not the most
rare and precious, perhaps, but of the very first water of their kind.</p>
<p>That he took trouble with his gems, taking them up in the rough and
polishing each facet patiently, the publication of the two posthumous
volumes of short stories proves abundantly.&nbsp; I think it proves
also the assertion made here that he was by no means a dealer in words.&nbsp;
On looking at the first feeble drafts from which so many perfect stories
have been fashioned, one discovers that what has been matured, improved,
brought to perfection by unwearied endeavour is not the diction of the
tale, but the vision of its true shape and detail.&nbsp; Those first
attempts are not faltering or uncertain in expression.&nbsp; It is the
conception which is at fault.&nbsp; The subjects have not yet been adequately
seen.&nbsp; His proceeding was not to group expressive words, that mean
nothing, around misty and mysterious shapes dear to muddled intellects
and belonging neither to earth nor to heaven.&nbsp; His vision by a
more scrupulous, prolonged and devoted attention to the aspects of the
visible world discovered at last the right words as if miraculously
impressed for him upon the face of things and events.&nbsp; This was
the particular shape taken by his inspiration; it came to him directly,
honestly in the light of his day, not on the tortuous, dark roads of
meditation.&nbsp; His realities came to him from a genuine source, from
this universe of vain appearances wherein we men have found everything
to make us proud, sorry, exalted, and humble.</p>
<p>Maupassant&rsquo;s renown is universal, but his popularity is restricted.&nbsp;
It is not difficult to perceive why.&nbsp; Maupassant is an intensely
national writer.&nbsp; He is so intensely national in his logic, in
his clearness, in his &aelig;sthetic and moral conceptions, that he
has been accepted by his countrymen without having had to pay the tribute
of flattery either to the nation as a whole, or to any class, sphere
or division of the nation.&nbsp; The truth of his art tells with an
irresistible force; and he stands excused from the duty of patriotic
posturing.&nbsp; He is a Frenchman of Frenchmen beyond question or cavil,
and with that he is simple enough to be universally comprehensible.&nbsp;
What is wanting to his universal success is the mediocrity of an obvious
and appealing tenderness.&nbsp; He neglects to qualify his truth with
the drop of facile sweetness; he forgets to strew paper roses over the
tombs.&nbsp; The disregard of these common decencies lays him open to
the charges of cruelty, cynicism, hardness.&nbsp; And yet it can be
safely affirmed that this man wrote from the fulness of a compassionate
heart.&nbsp; He is merciless and yet gentle with his mankind; he does
not rail at their prudent fears and their small artifices; he does not
despise their labours.&nbsp; It seems to me that he looks with an eye
of profound pity upon their troubles, deceptions and misery.&nbsp; But
he looks at them all.&nbsp; He sees&mdash;and does not turn away his
head.&nbsp; As a matter of fact he is courageous.</p>
<p>Courage and justice are not popular virtues.&nbsp; The practice of
strict justice is shocking to the multitude who always (perhaps from
an obscure sense of guilt) attach to it the meaning of mercy.&nbsp;
In the majority of us, who want to be left alone with our illusions,
courage inspires a vague alarm.&nbsp; This is what is felt about Maupassant.&nbsp;
His qualities, to use the charming and popular phrase, are not lovable.&nbsp;
Courage being a force will not masquerade in the robes of affected delicacy
and restraint.&nbsp; But if his courage is not of a chivalrous stamp,
it cannot be denied that it is never brutal for the sake of effect.&nbsp;
The writer of these few reflections, inspired by a long and intimate
acquaintance with the work of the man, has been struck by the appreciation
of Maupassant manifested by many women gifted with tenderness and intelligence.&nbsp;
Their more delicate and audacious souls are good judges of courage.&nbsp;
Their finer penetration has discovered his genuine masculinity without
display, his virility without a pose.&nbsp; They have discerned in his
faithful dealings with the world that enterprising and fearless temperament,
poor in ideas but rich in power, which appeals most to the feminine
mind.</p>
<p>It cannot be denied that he thinks very little.&nbsp; In him extreme
energy of perception achieves great results, as in men of action the
energy of force and desire.&nbsp; His view of intellectual problems
is perhaps more simple than their nature warrants; still a man who has
written <i>Yvette</i> cannot be accused of want of subtlety.&nbsp; But
one cannot insist enough upon this, that his subtlety, his humour, his
grimness, though no doubt they are his own, are never presented otherwise
but as belonging to our life, as found in nature, whose beauties and
cruelties alike breathe the spirit of serene unconsciousness.</p>
<p>Maupassant&rsquo;s philosophy of life is more temperamental than
rational.&nbsp; He expects nothing from gods or men.&nbsp; He trusts
his senses for information and his instinct for deductions.&nbsp; It
may seem that he has made but little use of his mind.&nbsp; But let
me be clearly understood.&nbsp; His sensibility is really very great;
and it is impossible to be sensible, unless one thinks vividly, unless
one thinks correctly, starting from intelligible premises to an unsophisticated
conclusion.</p>
<p>This is literary honesty.&nbsp; It may be remarked that it does not
differ very greatly from the ideal honesty of the respectable majority,
from the honesty of law-givers, of warriors, of kings, of bricklayers,
of all those who express their fundamental sentiment in the ordinary
course of their activities, by the work of their hands.</p>
<p>The work of Maupassant&rsquo;s hands is honest.&nbsp; He thinks sufficiently
to concrete his fearless conclusions in illuminative instances.&nbsp;
He renders them with that exact knowledge of the means and that absolute
devotion to the aim of creating a true effect&mdash;which is art.&nbsp;
He is the most accomplished of narrators.</p>
<p>It is evident that Maupassant looked upon his mankind in another
spirit than those writers who make haste to submerge the difficulties
of our holding-place in the universe under a flood of false and sentimental
assumptions.&nbsp; Maupassant was a true and dutiful lover of our earth.&nbsp;
He says himself in one of his descriptive passages: &ldquo;Nous autres
que s&eacute;duit la terre . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; It was true.&nbsp; The
earth had for him a compelling charm.&nbsp; He looks upon her august
and furrowed face with the fierce insight of real passion.&nbsp; His
is the power of detecting the one immutable quality that matters in
the changing aspects of nature and under the ever-shifting surface of
life.&nbsp; To say that he could not embrace in his glance all its magnificence
and all its misery is only to say that he was human.&nbsp; He lays claim
to nothing that his matchless vision has not made his own.&nbsp; This
creative artist has the true imagination; he never condescends to invent
anything; he sets up no empty pretences.&nbsp; And he stoops to no littleness
in his art&mdash;least of all to the miserable vanity of a catching
phrase.</p>
<h3>ANATOLE FRANCE&mdash;1904</h3>
<h4>I.&mdash;&ldquo;CRAINQUEBILLE&rdquo;</h4>
<p>The latest volume of M. Anatole France purports, by the declaration
of its title-page, to contain several profitable narratives.&nbsp; The
story of Crainquebille&rsquo;s encounter with human justice stands at
the head of them; a tale of a well-bestowed charity closes the book
with the touch of playful irony characteristic of the writer on whom
the most distinguished amongst his literary countrymen have conferred
the rank of Prince of Prose.</p>
<p>Never has a dignity been better borne.&nbsp; M. Anatole France is
a good prince.&nbsp; He knows nothing of tyranny but much of compassion.&nbsp;
The detachment of his mind from common errors and current superstitions
befits the exalted rank he holds in the Commonwealth of Literature.&nbsp;
It is just to suppose that the clamour of the tribes in the forum had
little to do with his elevation.&nbsp; Their elect are of another stamp.&nbsp;
They are such as their need of precipitate action requires.&nbsp; He
is the Elect of the Senate&mdash;the Senate of Letters&mdash;whose Conscript
Fathers have recognised him as <i>primus inter pares</i>; a post of
pure honour and of no privilege.</p>
<p>It is a good choice.&nbsp; First, because it is just, and next, because
it is safe.&nbsp; The dignity will suffer no diminution in M. Anatole
France&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; He is worthy of a great tradition, learned
in the lessons of the past, concerned with the present, and as earnest
as to the future as a good prince should be in his public action.&nbsp;
It is a Republican dignity.&nbsp; And M. Anatole France, with his sceptical
insight into an forms of government, is a good Republican.&nbsp; He
is indulgent to the weaknesses of the people, and perceives that political
institutions, whether contrived by the wisdom of the few or the ignorance
of the many, are incapable of securing the happiness of mankind.&nbsp;
He perceives this truth in the serenity of his soul and in the elevation
of his mind.&nbsp; He expresses his convictions with measure, restraint
and harmony, which are indeed princely qualities.&nbsp; He is a great
analyst of illusions.&nbsp; He searches and probes their innermost recesses
as if they were realities made of an eternal substance.&nbsp; And therein
consists his humanity; this is the expression of his profound and unalterable
compassion.&nbsp; He will flatter no tribe no section in the forum or
in the market-place.&nbsp; His lucid thought is not beguiled into false
pity or into the common weakness of affection.&nbsp; He feels that men
born in ignorance as in the house of an enemy, and condemned to struggle
with error and passions through endless centuries, should be spared
the supreme cruelty of a hope for ever deferred.&nbsp; He knows that
our best hopes are irrealisable; that it is the almost incredible misfortune
of mankind, but also its highest privilege, to aspire towards the impossible;
that men have never failed to defeat their highest aims by the very
strength of their humanity which can conceive the most gigantic tasks
but leaves them disarmed before their irremediable littleness.&nbsp;
He knows this well because he is an artist and a master; but he knows,
too, that only in the continuity of effort there is a refuge from despair
for minds less clear-seeing and philosophic than his own.&nbsp; Therefore
he wishes us to believe and to hope, preserving in our activity the
consoling illusion of power and intelligent purpose.&nbsp; He is a good
and politic prince.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The majesty of justice is contained entire in each sentence
pronounced by the judge in the name of the sovereign people.&nbsp; J&eacute;rome
Crainquebille, hawker of vegetables, became aware of the august aspect
of the law as he stood indicted before the tribunal of the higher Police
Court on a charge of insulting a constable of the force.&rdquo;&nbsp;
With this exposition begins the first tale of M. Anatole France&rsquo;s
latest volume.</p>
<p>The bust of the Republic and the image of the Crucified Christ appear
side by side above the bench occupied by the President Bourriche and
his two Assessors; all the laws divine and human are suspended over
the head of Crainquebille.</p>
<p>From the first visual impression of the accused and of the court
the author passes by a characteristic and natural turn to the historical
and moral significance of those two emblems of State and Religion whose
accord is only possible to the confused reasoning of an average man.&nbsp;
But the reasoning of M. Anatole France is never confused.&nbsp; His
reasoning is clear and informed by a profound erudition.&nbsp; Such
is not the case of Crainquebille, a street hawker, charged with insulting
the constituted power of society in the person of a policeman.&nbsp;
The charge is not true, nothing was further from his thoughts; but,
amazed by the novelty of his position, he does not reflect that the
Cross on the wall perpetuates the memory of a sentence which for nineteen
hundred years all the Christian peoples have looked upon as a grave
miscarriage of justice.&nbsp; He might well have challenged the President
to pronounce any sort of sentence, if it were merely to forty-eight
hours of simple imprisonment, in the name of the Crucified Redeemer.</p>
<p>He might have done so.&nbsp; But Crainquebille, who has lived pushing
every day for half a century his hand-barrow loaded with vegetables
through the streets of Paris, has not a philosophic mind.&nbsp; Truth
to say he has nothing.&nbsp; He is one of the disinherited.&nbsp; Properly
speaking, he has no existence at all, or, to be strictly truthful, he
had no existence till M. Anatole France&rsquo;s philosophic mind and
human sympathy have called him up from his nothingness for our pleasure,
and, as the title-page of the book has it, no doubt for our profit also.</p>
<p>Therefore we behold him in the dock, a stranger to all historical,
political or social considerations which can be brought to bear upon
his case.&nbsp; He remains lost in astonishment.&nbsp; Penetrated with
respect, overwhelmed with awe, he is ready to trust the judge upon the
question of his transgression.&nbsp; In his conscience he does not think
himself culpable; but M. Anatole France&rsquo;s philosophical mind discovers
for us that he feels all the insignificance of such a thing as the conscience
of a mere street-hawker in the face of the symbols of the law and before
the ministers of social repression.&nbsp; Crainquebille is innocent;
but already the young advocate, his defender, has half persuaded him
of his guilt.</p>
<p>On this phrase practically ends the introductory chapter of the story
which, as the author&rsquo;s dedication states, has inspired an admirable
draughtsman and a skilful dramatist, each in his art, to a vision of
tragic grandeur.&nbsp; And this opening chapter without a name&mdash;consisting
of two and a half pages, some four hundred words at most&mdash;is a
masterpiece of insight and simplicity, resumed in M. Anatole France&rsquo;s
distinction of thought and in his princely command of words.</p>
<p>It is followed by six more short chapters, concise and full, delicate
and complete like the petals of a flower, presenting to us the Adventure
of Crainquebille&mdash;Crainquebille before the justice&mdash;An Apology
for the President of the Tribunal&mdash;Of the Submission of Crainquebille
to the Laws of the Republic&mdash;Of his Attitude before the Public
Opinion, and so on to the chapter of the Last Consequences.&nbsp; We
see, created for us in his outward form and innermost perplexity, the
old man degraded from his high estate of a law-abiding street-hawker
and driven to insult, really this time, the majesty of the social order
in the person of another police-constable.&nbsp; It is not an act of
revolt, and still less of revenge.&nbsp; Crainquebille is too old, too
resigned, too weary, too guileless to raise the black standard of insurrection.&nbsp;
He is cold and homeless and starving.&nbsp; He remembers the warmth
and the food of the prison.&nbsp; He perceives the means to get back
there.&nbsp; Since he has been locked up, he argues with himself, for
uttering words which, as a matter of fact he did not say, he will go
forth now, and to the first policeman he meets will say those very words
in order to be imprisoned again.&nbsp; Thus reasons Crainquebille with
simplicity and confidence.&nbsp; He accepts facts.&nbsp; Nothing surprises
him.&nbsp; But all the phenomena of social organisation and of his own
life remain for him mysterious to the end.&nbsp; The description of
the policeman in his short cape and hood, who stands quite still, under
the light of a street lamp at the edge of the pavement shining with
the wet of a rainy autumn evening along the whole extent of a long and
deserted thoroughfare, is a perfect piece of imaginative precision.&nbsp;
From under the edge of the hood his eyes look upon Crainquebille, who
has just uttered in an uncertain voice the sacramental, insulting phrase
of the popular slang&mdash;<i>Mort aux vaches</i>!&nbsp; They look upon
him shining in the deep shadow of the hood with an expression of sadness,
vigilance, and contempt.</p>
<p>He does not move.&nbsp; Crainquebille, in a feeble and hesitating
voice, repeats once more the insulting words.&nbsp; But this policeman
is full of philosophic superiority, disdain, and indulgence.&nbsp; He
refuses to take in charge the old and miserable vagabond who stands
before him shivering and ragged in the drizzle.&nbsp; And the ruined
Crainquebille, victim of a ridiculous miscarriage of justice, appalled
at this magnanimity, passes on hopelessly down the street full of shadows
where the lamps gleam each in a ruddy halo of falling mist.</p>
<p>M. Anatole France can speak for the people.&nbsp; This prince of
the Senate is invested with the tribunitian power.&nbsp; M. Anatole
France is something of a Socialist; and in that respect he seems to
depart from his sceptical philosophy.&nbsp; But as an illustrious statesman,
now no more, a great prince too, with an ironic mind and a literary
gift, has sarcastically remarked in one of his public speeches: &ldquo;We
are all Socialists now.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in the sense in which it may
be said that we all in Europe are Christians that is true enough.&nbsp;
To many of us Socialism is merely an emotion.&nbsp; An emotion is much
and is also less than nothing.&nbsp; It is the initial impulse.&nbsp;
The real Socialism of to-day is a religion.&nbsp; It has its dogmas.&nbsp;
The value of the dogma does not consist in its truthfulness, and M.
Anatole France, who loves truth, does not love dogma.&nbsp; Only, unlike
religion, the cohesive strength of Socialism lies not in its dogmas
but in its ideal.&nbsp; It is perhaps a too materialistic ideal, and
the mind of M. Anatole France may not find in it either comfort or consolation.&nbsp;
It is not to be doubted that he suspects this himself; but there is
something reposeful in the finality of popular conceptions.&nbsp; M.
Anatole France, a good prince and a good Republican, will succeed no
doubt in being a good Socialist.&nbsp; He will disregard the stupidity
of the dogma and the unlovely form of the ideal.&nbsp; His art will
find its own beauty in the imaginative presentation of wrongs, of errors,
and miseries that call aloud for redress.&nbsp; M. Anatole France is
humane.&nbsp; He is also human.&nbsp; He may be able to discard his
philosophy; to forget that the evils are many and the remedies are few,
that there is no universal panacea, that fatality is invincible, that
there is an implacable menace of death in the triumph of the humanitarian
idea.&nbsp; He may forget all that because love is stronger than truth.</p>
<p>Besides &ldquo;Crainquebille&rdquo; this volume contains sixteen
other stories and sketches.&nbsp; To define them it is enough to say
that they are written in M. Anatole France&rsquo;s prose.&nbsp; One
sketch entitled &ldquo;Riquet&rdquo; may be found incorporated in the
volume of <i>Monsieur Bergeret &agrave; Paris</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Putois&rdquo;
is a remarkable little tale, significant, humorous, amusing, and symbolic.&nbsp;
It concerns the career of a man born in the utterance of a hasty and
untruthful excuse made by a lady at a loss how to decline without offence
a very pressing invitation to dinner from a very tyrannical aunt.&nbsp;
This happens in a provincial town, and the lady says in effect: &ldquo;Impossible,
my dear aunt.&nbsp; To-morrow I am expecting the gardener.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And the garden she glances at is a poor garden; it is a wild garden;
its extent is insignificant and its neglect seems beyond remedy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A gardener!&nbsp; What for?&rdquo; asks the aunt.&nbsp; &ldquo;To
work in the garden.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the poor lady is abashed at the
transparence of her evasion.&nbsp; But the lie is told, it is believed,
and she sticks to it.&nbsp; When the masterful old aunt inquires, &ldquo;What
is the man&rsquo;s name, my dear?&rdquo; she answers brazenly, &ldquo;His
name is Putois.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Where does he live?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know; anywhere.&nbsp; He won&rsquo;t give his
address.&nbsp; One leaves a message for him here and there.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; I see,&rdquo; says the other; &ldquo;he is a sort of
ne&rsquo;er do well, an idler, a vagabond.&nbsp; I advise you, my dear,
to be careful how you let such a creature into your grounds; but I have
a large garden, and when you do not want his services I shall find him
some work to do, and see he does it too.&nbsp; Tell your Putois to come
and see me.&rdquo;&nbsp; And thereupon Putois is born; he stalks abroad,
invisible, upon his career of vagabondage and crime, stealing melons
from gardens and tea-spoons from pantries, indulging his licentious
proclivities; becoming the talk of the town and of the countryside;
seen simultaneously in far-distant places; pursued by gendarmes, whose
brigadier assures the uneasy householders that he &ldquo;knows that
scamp very well, and won&rsquo;t be long in laying his hands upon him.&rdquo;&nbsp;
A detailed description of his person collected from the information
furnished by various people appears in the columns of a local newspaper.&nbsp;
Putois lives in his strength and malevolence.&nbsp; He lives after the
manner of legendary heroes, of the gods of Olympus.&nbsp; He is the
creation of the popular mind.&nbsp; There comes a time when even the
innocent originator of that mysterious and potent evil-doer is induced
to believe for a moment that he may have a real and tangible presence.&nbsp;
All this is told with the wit and the art and the philosophy which is
familiar to M. Anatole France&rsquo;s readers and admirers.&nbsp; For
it is difficult to read M. Anatole France without admiring him.&nbsp;
He has the princely gift of arousing a spontaneous loyalty, but with
this difference, that the consent of our reason has its place by the
side of our enthusiasm.&nbsp; He is an artist.&nbsp; As an artist he
awakens emotion.&nbsp; The quality of his art remains, as an inspiration,
fascinating and inscrutable; but the proceedings of his thought compel
our intellectual admiration.</p>
<p>In this volume the trifle called &ldquo;The Military Manoeuvres at
Montil,&rdquo; apart from its far-reaching irony, embodies incidentally
the very spirit of automobilism.&nbsp; Somehow or other, how you cannot
tell, the flight over the country in a motor-car, its sensations, its
fatigue, its vast topographical range, its incidents down to the bursting
of a tyre, are brought home to you with all the force of high imaginative
perception.&nbsp; It would be out of place to analyse here the means
by which the true impression is conveyed so that the absurd rushing
about of General Decuir, in a 30-horse-power car, in search of his cavalry
brigade, becomes to you a more real experience than any day-and-night
run you may ever have taken yourself.&nbsp; Suffice it to say that M.
Anatole France had thought the thing worth doing and that it becomes,
in virtue of his art, a distinct achievement.&nbsp; And there are other
sketches in this book, more or less slight, but all worthy of regard&mdash;the
childhood&rsquo;s recollections of Professor Bergeret and his sister
Zo&eacute;; the dialogue of the two upright judges and the conversation
of their horses; the dream of M. Jean Marteau, aimless, extravagant,
apocalyptic, and of all the dreams one ever dreamt, the most essentially
dreamlike.&nbsp; The vision of M. Anatole France, the Prince of Prose,
ranges over all the extent of his realm, indulgent and penetrating,
disillusioned and curious, finding treasures of truth and beauty concealed
from less gifted magicians.&nbsp; Contemplating the exactness of his
images and the justice of his judgment, the freedom of his fancy and
the fidelity of his purpose, one becomes aware of the futility of literary
watchwords and the vanity of all the schools of fiction.&nbsp; Not that
M. Anatole France is a wild and untrammelled genius.&nbsp; He is not
that.&nbsp; Issued legitimately from the past, he is mindful of his
high descent.&nbsp; He has a critical temperament joined to creative
power.&nbsp; He surveys his vast domain in a spirit of princely moderation
that knows nothing of excesses but much of restraint.</p>
<h4>II.&mdash;&ldquo;L&rsquo;&Icirc;LE DES PINGOUINS&rdquo;</h4>
<p>M. Anatole France, historian and adventurer, has given us many profitable
histories of saints and sinners, of Roman procurators and of officials
of the Third Republic, of <i>grandes dames</i> and of dames not so very
grand, of ornate Latinists and of inarticulate street hawkers, of priests
and generals&mdash;in fact, the history of all humanity as it appears
to his penetrating eye, serving a mind marvellously incisive in its
scepticism, and a heart that, of all contemporary hearts gifted with
a voice, contains the greatest treasure of charitable irony.&nbsp; As
to M. Anatole France&rsquo;s adventures, these are well-known.&nbsp;
They lie open to this prodigal world in the four volumes of the <i>Vie
Litt&eacute;raire</i>, describing the adventures of a choice soul amongst
masterpieces.&nbsp; For such is the romantic view M. Anatole France
takes of the life of a literary critic.&nbsp; History and adventure,
then, seem to be the chosen fields for the magnificent evolutions of
M. Anatole France&rsquo;s prose; but no material limits can stand in
the way of a genius.&nbsp; The latest book from his pen&mdash;which
may be called golden, as the lips of an eloquent saint once upon a time
were acclaimed golden by the faithful&mdash;this latest book is, up
to a certain point, a book of travel.</p>
<p>I would not mislead a public whose confidence I court.&nbsp; The
book is not a record of globe-trotting.&nbsp; I regret it.&nbsp; It
would have been a joy to watch M. Anatole France pouring the clear elixir
compounded of his Pyrrhonic philosophy, his Benedictine erudition, his
gentle wit and most humane irony into such an unpromising and opaque
vessel.&nbsp; He would have attempted it in a spirit of benevolence
towards his fellow men and of compassion for that life of the earth
which is but a vain and transitory illusion.&nbsp; M. Anatole France
is a great magician, yet there seem to be tasks which he dare not face.&nbsp;
For he is also a sage.</p>
<p>It is a book of ocean travel&mdash;not, however, as understood by
Herr Ballin of Hamburg, the Machiavel of the Atlantic.&nbsp; It is a
book of exploration and discovery&mdash;not, however, as conceived by
an enterprising journal and a shrewdly philanthropic king of the nineteenth
century.&nbsp; It is nothing so recent as that.&nbsp; It dates much
further back; long, long before the dark age when Krupp of Essen wrought
at his steel plates and a German Emperor condescendingly suggested the
last improvements in ships&rsquo; dining-tables.&nbsp; The best idea
of the inconceivable antiquity of that enterprise I can give you is
by stating the nature of the explorer&rsquo;s ship.&nbsp; It was a trough
of stone, a vessel of hollowed granite.</p>
<p>The explorer was St. Ma&euml;l, a saint of Armorica.&nbsp; I had
never heard of him before, but I believe now in his arduous existence
with a faith which is a tribute to M. Anatole France&rsquo;s pious earnestness
and delicate irony.&nbsp; St. Ma&euml;l existed.&nbsp; It is distinctly
stated of him that his life was a progress in virtue.&nbsp; Thus it
seems that there may be saints that are not progressively virtuous.&nbsp;
St. Ma&euml;l was not of that kind.&nbsp; He was industrious.&nbsp;
He evangelised the heathen.&nbsp; He erected two hundred and eighteen
chapels and seventy-four abbeys.&nbsp; Indefatigable navigator of the
faith, he drifted casually in the miraculous trough of stone from coast
to coast and from island to island along the northern seas.&nbsp; At
the age of eighty-four his high stature was bowed by his long labours,
but his sinewy arms preserved their vigour and his rude eloquence had
lost nothing of its force.</p>
<p>A nautical devil tempting him by the worldly suggestion of fitting
out his desultory, miraculous trough with mast, sail, and rudder for
swifter progression (the idea of haste has sprung from the pride of
Satan), the simple old saint lent his ear to the subtle arguments of
the progressive enemy of mankind.</p>
<p>The venerable St. Ma&euml;l fell away from grace by not perceiving
at once that a gift of heaven cannot be improved by the contrivances
of human ingenuity.&nbsp; His punishment was adequate.&nbsp; A terrific
tempest snatched the rigged ship of stone in its whirlwinds, and, to
be brief, the dazed St. Ma&euml;l was stranded violently on the Island
of Penguins.</p>
<p>The saint wandered away from the shore.&nbsp; It was a flat, round
island whence rose in the centre a conical mountain capped with clouds.&nbsp;
The rain was falling incessantly&mdash;a gentle, soft rain which caused
the simple saint to exclaim in great delight: &ldquo;This is the island
of tears, the island of contrition!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meantime the inhabitants had flocked in their tens of thousands to
an amphitheatre of rocks; they were penguins; but the holy man, rendered
deaf and purblind by his years, mistook excusably the multitude of silly,
erect, and self-important birds for a human crowd.&nbsp; At once he
began to preach to them the doctrine of salvation.&nbsp; Having finished
his discourse he lost no time in administering to his interesting congregation
the sacrament of baptism.</p>
<p>If you are at all a theologian you will see that it was no mean adventure
to happen to a well-meaning and zealous saint.&nbsp; Pray reflect on
the magnitude of the issues!&nbsp; It is easy to believe what M. Anatole
France says, that, when the baptism of the Penguins became known in
Paradise, it caused there neither joy nor sorrow, but a profound sensation.</p>
<p>M. Anatole France is no mean theologian himself.&nbsp; He reports
with great casuistical erudition the debates in the saintly council
assembled in Heaven for the consideration of an event so disturbing
to the economy of religious mysteries.&nbsp; Ultimately the baptised
Penguins had to be turned into human beings; and together with the privilege
of sublime hopes these innocent birds received the curse of original
sin, with the labours, the miseries, the passions, and the weaknesses
attached to the fallen condition of humanity.</p>
<p>At this point M. Anatole France is again an historian.&nbsp; From
being the Hakluyt of a saintly adventurer he turns (but more concisely)
into the Gibbon of Imperial Penguins.&nbsp; Tracing the development
of their civilisation, the absurdity of their desires, the pathos of
their folly and the ridiculous littleness of their quarrels, his golden
pen lightens by relevant but unpuritanical anecdotes the austerity of
a work devoted to a subject so grave as the Polity of Penguins.&nbsp;
It is a very admirable treatment, and I hasten to congratulate all men
of receptive mind on the feast of wisdom which is theirs for the mere
plucking of a book from a shelf.</p>
<h3>TURGENEV <a name="citation2"></a><a href="#footnote2">{2}</a>&mdash;1917</h3>
<p>Dear Edward,</p>
<p>I am glad to hear that you are about to publish a study of Turgenev,
that fortunate artist who has found so much in life for us and no doubt
for himself, with the exception of bare justice.&nbsp; Perhaps that
will come to him, too, in time.&nbsp; Your study may help the consummation.&nbsp;
For his luck persists after his death.&nbsp; What greater luck an artist
like Turgenev could wish for than to find in the English-speaking world
a translator who has missed none of the most delicate, most simple beauties
of his work, and a critic who has known how to analyse and point out
its high qualities with perfect sympathy and insight.</p>
<p>After twenty odd years of friendship (and my first literary friendship
too) I may well permit myself to make that statement, while thinking
of your wonderful Prefaces as they appeared from time to time in the
volumes of Turgenev&rsquo;s complete edition, the last of which came
into the light of public indifference in the ninety-ninth year of the
nineteenth century.</p>
<p>With that year one may say, with some justice, that the age of Turgenev
had come to an end too; yet work so simple and human, so independent
of the transitory formulas and theories of art, belongs as you point
out in the Preface to <i>Smoke</i> &ldquo;to all time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turgenev&rsquo;s creative activity covers about thirty years.&nbsp;
Since it came to an end the social and political events in Russia have
moved at an accelerated pace, but the deep origins of them, in the moral
and intellectual unrest of the souls, are recorded in the whole body
of his work with the unerring lucidity of a great national writer.&nbsp;
The first stirrings, the first gleams of the great forces can be seen
almost in every page of the novels, of the short stories and of <i>A
Sportsman&rsquo;s Sketches</i>&mdash;those marvellous landscapes peopled
by unforgettable figures.</p>
<p>Those will never grow old.&nbsp; Fashions in monsters do change,
but the truth of humanity goes on for ever, unchangeable and inexhaustible
in the variety of its disclosures.&nbsp; Whether Turgenev&rsquo;s art,
which has captured it with such mastery and such gentleness, is for
&ldquo;all time&rdquo; it is hard to say.&nbsp; Since, as you say yourself,
he brings all his problems and characters to the test of love, we may
hope that it will endure at least till the infinite emotions of love
are replaced by the exact simplicity of perfected Eugenics.&nbsp; But
even by then, I think, women would not have changed much; and the women
of Turgenev who understood them so tenderly, so reverently and so passionately&mdash;they,
at least, are certainly for all time.</p>
<p>Women are, one may say, the foundation of his art.&nbsp; They are
Russian of course.&nbsp; Never was a writer so profoundly, so whole-souledly
national.&nbsp; But for non-Russian readers, Turgenev&rsquo;s Russia
is but a canvas on which the incomparable artist of humanity lays his
colours and his forms in the great light and the free air of the world.&nbsp;
Had he invented them all and also every stick and stone, brook and hill
and field in which they move, his personages would have been just as
true and as poignant in their perplexed lives.&nbsp; They are his own
and also universal.&nbsp; Any one can accept them with no more question
than one accepts the Italians of Shakespeare.</p>
<p>In the larger, non-Russian view, what should make Turgenev sympathetic
and welcome to the English-speaking world, is his essential humanity.&nbsp;
All his creations, fortunate and unfortunate, oppressed and oppressors,
are human beings, not strange beasts in a menagerie or damned souls
knocking themselves to pieces in the stuffy darkness of mystical contradictions.&nbsp;
They are human beings, fit to live, fit to suffer, fit to struggle,
fit to win, fit to lose, in the endless and inspiring game of pursuing
from day to day the ever-receding future.</p>
<p>I began by calling him lucky, and he was, in a sense.&nbsp; But one
ends by having some doubts.&nbsp; To be so great without the slightest
parade and so fine without any tricks of &ldquo;cleverness&rdquo; must
be fatal to any man&rsquo;s influence with his contemporaries.</p>
<p>Frankly, I don&rsquo;t want to appear as qualified to judge of things
Russian.&nbsp; It wouldn&rsquo;t be true.&nbsp; I know nothing of them.&nbsp;
But I am aware of a few general truths, such as, for instance, that
no man, whatever may be the loftiness of his character, the purity of
his motives and the peace of his conscience&mdash;no man, I say, likes
to be beaten with sticks during the greater part of his existence.&nbsp;
From what one knows of his history it appears clearly that in Russia
almost any stick was good enough to beat Turgenev with in his latter
years.&nbsp; When he died the characteristically chicken-hearted Autocracy
hastened to stuff his mortal envelope into the tomb it refused to honour,
while the sensitive Revolutionists went on for a time flinging after
his shade those jeers and curses from which that impartial lover of
<i>all</i> his countrymen had suffered so much in his lifetime.&nbsp;
For he, too, was sensitive.&nbsp; Every page of his writing bears its
testimony to the fatal absence of callousness in the man.</p>
<p>And now he suffers a little from other things.&nbsp; In truth it
is not the convulsed terror-haunted Dostoievski but the serene Turgenev
who is under a curse.&nbsp; For only think!&nbsp; Every gift has been
heaped on his cradle: absolute sanity and the deepest sensibility, the
clearest vision and the quickest responsiveness, penetrating insight
and unfailing generosity of judgment, an exquisite perception of the
visible world and an unerring instinct for the significant, for the
essential in the life of men and women, the clearest mind, the warmest
heart, the largest sympathy&mdash;and all that in perfect measure.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s enough there to ruin the prospects of any writer.&nbsp;
For you know very well, my dear Edward, that if you had Antinous himself
in a booth of the world&rsquo;s fair, and killed yourself in protesting
that his soul was as perfect as his body, you wouldn&rsquo;t get one
per cent. of the crowd struggling next door for a sight of the Double-headed
Nightingale or of some weak-kneed giant grinning through a horse collar.</p>

<h3>STEPHEN CRANE&mdash;A NOTE WITHOUT DATES&mdash;1919</h3>
<p>My acquaintance with Stephen Crane was brought about by Mr. Pawling,
partner in the publishing firm of Mr. William Heinemann.</p>
<p>One day Mr. Pawling said to me: &ldquo;Stephen Crane has arrived
in England.&nbsp; I asked him if there was anybody he wanted to meet
and he mentioned two names.&nbsp; One of them was yours.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I had then just been reading, like the rest of the world, Crane&rsquo;s
<i>Red Badge of Courage</i>.&nbsp; The subject of that story was war,
from the point of view of an individual soldier&rsquo;s emotions.&nbsp;
That individual (he remains nameless throughout) was interesting enough
in himself, but on turning over the pages of that little book which
had for the moment secured such a noisy recognition I had been even
more interested in the personality of the writer.&nbsp; The picture
of a simple and untried youth becoming through the needs of his country
part of a great fighting machine was presented with an earnestness of
purpose, a sense of tragic issues, and an imaginative force of expression
which struck me as quite uncommon and altogether worthy of admiration.</p>
<p>Apparently Stephen Crane had received a favourable impression from
the reading of the <i>Nigger of the Narcissus</i>, a book of mine which
had also been published lately.&nbsp; I was truly pleased to hear this.</p>
<p>On my next visit to town we met at a lunch.&nbsp; I saw a young man
of medium stature and slender build, with very steady, penetrating blue
eyes, the eyes of a being who not only sees visions but can brood over
them to some purpose.</p>
<p>He had indeed a wonderful power of vision, which he applied to the
things of this earth and of our mortal humanity with a penetrating force
that seemed to reach, within life&rsquo;s appearances and forms, the
very spirit of life&rsquo;s truth.&nbsp; His ignorance of the world
at large&mdash;he had seen very little of it&mdash;did not stand in
the way of his imaginative grasp of facts, events, and picturesque men.</p>
<p>His manner was very quiet, his personality at first sight interesting,
and he talked slowly with an intonation which on some people, mainly
Americans, had, I believe, a jarring effect.&nbsp; But not on me.&nbsp;
Whatever he said had a personal note, and he expressed himself with
a graphic simplicity which was extremely engaging.&nbsp; He knew little
of literature, either of his own country or of any other, but he was
himself a wonderful artist in words whenever he took a pen into his
hand.&nbsp; Then his gift came out&mdash;and it was seen then to be
much more than mere felicity of language.&nbsp; His impressionism of
phrase went really deeper than the surface.&nbsp; In his writing he
was very sure of his effects.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think he was ever
in doubt about what he could do.&nbsp; Yet it often seemed to me that
he was but half aware of the exceptional quality of his achievement.</p>
<p>This achievement was curtailed by his early death.&nbsp; It was a
great loss to his friends, but perhaps not so much to literature.&nbsp;
I think that he had given his measure fully in the few books he had
the time to write.&nbsp; Let me not be misunderstood: the loss was great,
but it was the loss of the delight his art could give, not the loss
of any further possible revelation.&nbsp; As to himself, who can say
how much he gained or lost by quitting so early this world of the living,
which he knew how to set before us in the terms of his own artistic
vision?&nbsp; Perhaps he did not lose a great deal.&nbsp; The recognition
he was accorded was rather languid and given him grudgingly.&nbsp; The
worthiest welcome he secured for his tales in this country was from
Mr. W. Henley in the <i>New Review</i> and later, towards the end of
his life, from the late Mr. William Blackwood in his magazine.&nbsp;
For the rest I must say that during his sojourn in England he had the
misfortune to be, as the French say, <i>mal entour&eacute;</i>.&nbsp;
He was beset by people who understood not the quality of his genius
and were antagonistic to the deeper fineness of his nature.&nbsp; Some
of them have died since, but dead or alive they are not worth speaking
about now.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think he had any illusions about them
himself: yet there was a strain of good-nature and perhaps of weakness
in his character which prevented him from shaking himself free from
their worthless and patronising attentions, which in those days caused
me much secret irritation whenever I stayed with him in either of his
English homes.&nbsp; My wife and I like best to remember him riding
to meet us at the gate of the Park at Brede.&nbsp; Born master of his
sincere impressions, he was also a born horseman.&nbsp; He never appeared
so happy or so much to advantage as on the back of a horse.&nbsp; He
had formed the project of teaching my eldest boy to ride, and meantime,
when the child was about two years old, presented him with his first
dog.</p>
<p>I saw Stephen Crane a few days after his arrival in London.&nbsp;
I saw him for the last time on his last day in England.&nbsp; It was
in Dover, in a big hotel, in a bedroom with a large window looking on
to the sea.&nbsp; He had been very ill and Mrs. Crane was taking him
to some place in Germany, but one glance at that wasted face was enough
to tell me that it was the most forlorn of all hopes.&nbsp; The last
words he breathed out to me were: &ldquo;I am tired.&nbsp; Give my love
to your wife and child.&rdquo;&nbsp; When I stopped at the door for
another look I saw that he had turned his head on the pillow and was
staring wistfully out of the window at the sails of a cutter yacht that
glided slowly across the frame, like a dim shadow against the grey sky.</p>
<p>Those who have read his little tale, &ldquo;Horses,&rdquo; and the
story, &ldquo;The Open Boat,&rdquo; in the volume of that name, know
with what fine understanding he loved horses and the sea.&nbsp; And
his passage on this earth was like that of a horseman riding swiftly
in the dawn of a day fated to be short and without sunshine.</p>
<h3>TALES OF THE SEA&mdash;1898</h3>
<p>It is by his irresistible power to reach the adventurous side in
the character, not only of his own, but of all nations, that Marryat
is largely human.&nbsp; He is the enslaver of youth, not by the literary
artifices of presentation, but by the natural glamour of his own temperament.&nbsp;
To his young heroes the beginning of life is a splendid and warlike
lark, ending at last in inheritance and marriage.&nbsp; His novels are
not the outcome of his art, but of his character, like the deeds that
make up his record of naval service.&nbsp; To the artist his work is
interesting as a completely successful expression of an unartistic nature.&nbsp;
It is absolutely amazing to us, as the disclosure of the spirit animating
the stirring time when the nineteenth century was young.&nbsp; There
is an air of fable about it.&nbsp; Its loss would be irreparable, like
the curtailment of national story or the loss of an historical document.&nbsp;
It is the beginning and the embodiment of an inspiring tradition.</p>
<p>To this writer of the sea the sea was not an element.&nbsp; It was
a stage, where was displayed an exhibition of valour, and of such achievement
as the world had never seen before.&nbsp; The greatness of that achievement
cannot be pronounced imaginary, since its reality has affected the destinies
of nations; nevertheless, in its grandeur it has all the remoteness
of an ideal.&nbsp; History preserves the skeleton of facts and, here
and there, a figure or a name; but it is in Marryat&rsquo;s novels that
we find the mass of the nameless, that we see them in the flesh, that
we obtain a glimpse of the everyday life and an insight into the spirit
animating the crowd of obscure men who knew how to build for their country
such a shining monument of memories.</p>
<p>Marryat is really a writer of the Service.&nbsp; What sets him apart
is his fidelity.&nbsp; His pen serves his country as well as did his
professional skill and his renowned courage.&nbsp; His figures move
about between water and sky, and the water and the sky are there only
to frame the deeds of the Service.&nbsp; His novels, like amphibious
creatures, live on the sea and frequent the shore, where they flounder
deplorably.&nbsp; The loves and the hates of his boys are as primitive
as their virtues and their vices.&nbsp; His women, from the beautiful
Agnes to the witch-like mother of Lieutenant Vanslyperken, are, with
the exception of the sailors&rsquo; wives, like the shadows of what
has never been.&nbsp; His Silvas, his Ribieras, his Shriftens, his Delmars
remind us of people we have heard of somewhere, many times, without
ever believing in their existence.&nbsp; His morality is honourable
and conventional.&nbsp; There is cruelty in his fun and he can invent
puns in the midst of carnage.&nbsp; His na&iuml;veties are perpetrated
in a lurid light.&nbsp; There is an endless variety of types, all surface,
with hard edges, with memorable eccentricities of outline, with a childish
and heroic effect in the drawing.&nbsp; They do not belong to life;
they belong exclusively to the Service.&nbsp; And yet they live; there
is a truth in them, the truth of their time; a headlong, reckless audacity,
an intimacy with violence, an unthinking fearlessness, and an exuberance
of vitality which only years of war and victories can give.&nbsp; His
adventures are enthralling; the rapidity of his action fascinates; his
method is crude, his sentimentality, obviously incidental, is often
factitious.&nbsp; His greatness is undeniable.</p>
<p>It is undeniable.&nbsp; To a multitude of readers the navy of to-day
is Marryat&rsquo;s navy still.&nbsp; He has created a priceless legend.&nbsp;
If he be not immortal, yet he will last long enough for the highest
ambition, because he has dealt manfully with an inspiring phase in the
history of that Service on which the life of his country depends.&nbsp;
The tradition of the great past he has fixed in his pages will be cherished
for ever as the guarantee of the future.&nbsp; He loved his country
first, the Service next, the sea perhaps not at all.&nbsp; But the sea
loved him without reserve.&nbsp; It gave him his professional distinction
and his author&rsquo;s fame&mdash;a fame such as not often falls to
the lot of a true artist.</p>
<p>At the same time, on the other side of the Atlantic, another man
wrote of the sea with true artistic instinct.&nbsp; He is not invincibly
young and heroic; he is mature and human, though for him also the stress
of adventure and endeavour must end fatally in inheritance and marriage.&nbsp;
For James Fenimore Cooper nature was not the frame-work, it was an essential
part of existence.&nbsp; He could hear its voice, he could understand
its silence, and he could interpret both for us in his prose with all
that felicity and sureness of effect that belong to a poetical conception
alone.&nbsp; His fame, as wide but less brilliant than that of his contemporary,
rests mostly on a novel which is not of the sea.&nbsp; But he loved
the sea and looked at it with consummate understanding.&nbsp; In his
sea tales the sea inter-penetrates with life; it is in a subtle way
a factor in the problem of existence, and, for all its greatness, it
is always in touch with the men, who, bound on errands of war or gain,
traverse its immense solitudes.&nbsp; His descriptions have the magistral
ampleness of a gesture indicating the sweep of a vast horizon.&nbsp;
They embrace the colours of sunset, the peace of starlight, the aspects
of calm and storm, the great loneliness of the waters, the stillness
of watchful coasts, and the alert readiness which marks men who live
face to face with the promise and the menace of the sea.</p>
<p>He knows the men and he knows the sea.&nbsp; His method may be often
faulty, but his art is genuine.&nbsp; The truth is within him.&nbsp;
The road to legitimate realism is through poetical feeling, and he possesses
that&mdash;only it is expressed in the leisurely manner of his time.&nbsp;
He has the knowledge of simple hearts.&nbsp; Long Tom Coffin is a monumental
seaman with the individuality of life and the significance of a type.&nbsp;
It is hard to believe that Manual and Borroughcliffe, Mr. Marble of
Marble-Head, Captain Tuck of the packet-ship <i>Montauk</i>, or Daggett,
the tenacious commander of the <i>Sea Lion</i> of Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard,
must pass away some day and be utterly forgotten.&nbsp; His sympathy
is large, and his humour is as genuine&mdash;and as perfectly unaffected&mdash;as
is his art.&nbsp; In certain passages he reaches, very simply, the heights
of inspired vision.</p>
<p>He wrote before the great American language was born, and he wrote
as well as any novelist of his time.&nbsp; If he pitches upon episodes
redounding to the glory of the young republic, surely England has glory
enough to forgive him, for the sake of his excellence, the patriotic
bias at her expense.&nbsp; The interest of his tales is convincing and
unflagging; and there runs through his work a steady vein of friendliness
for the old country which the succeeding generations of his compatriots
have replaced by a less definite sentiment.</p>
<p>Perhaps no two authors of fiction influenced so many lives and gave
to so many the initial impulse towards a glorious or a useful career.&nbsp;
Through the distances of space and time those two men of another race
have shaped also the life of the writer of this appreciation.&nbsp;
Life is life, and art is art&mdash;and truth is hard to find in either.&nbsp;
Yet in testimony to the achievement of both these authors it may be
said that, in the case of the writer at least, the youthful glamour,
the headlong vitality of the one and the profound sympathy, the artistic
insight of the other&mdash;to which he had surrendered&mdash;have withstood
the brutal shock of facts and the wear of laborious years.&nbsp; He
has never regretted his surrender.</p>
<h3>AN OBSERVER IN MALAYA <a name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3">{3}</a>&mdash;1898</h3>
<p>In his new volume, Mr. Hugh Clifford, at the beginning of the sketch
entitled &ldquo;At the Heels of the White Man,&rdquo; expresses his
anxiety as to the state of England&rsquo;s account in the Day-Book of
the Recording Angel &ldquo;for the good and the bad we have done&mdash;both
with the most excellent intentions.&rdquo;&nbsp; The intentions will,
no doubt, count for something, though, of course, every nation&rsquo;s
conquests are paved with good intentions; or it may be that the Recording
Angel, looking compassionately at the strife of hearts, may disdain
to enter into the Eternal Book the facts of a struggle which has the
reward of its righteousness even on this earth&mdash;in victory and
lasting greatness, or in defeat and humiliation.</p>
<p>And, also, love will count for much.&nbsp; If the opinion of a looker-on
from afar is worth anything, Mr. Hugh Clifford&rsquo;s anxiety about
his country&rsquo;s record is needless.&nbsp; To the Malays whom he
governs, instructs, and guides he is the embodiment of the intentions,
of the conscience and might of his race.&nbsp; And of all the nations
conquering distant territories in the name of the most excellent intentions,
England alone sends out men who, with such a transparent sincerity of
feeling, can speak, as Mr. Hugh Clifford does, of the place of toil
and exile as &ldquo;the land which is very dear to me, where the best
years of my life have been spent&rdquo;&mdash;and where (I would stake
my right hand on it) his name is pronounced with respect and affection
by those brown men about whom he writes.</p>
<p>All these studies are on a high level of interest, though not all
on the same level.&nbsp; The descriptive chapters, results of personal
observation, seem to me the most interesting.&nbsp; And, indeed, in
a book of this kind it is the author&rsquo;s personality which awakens
the greatest interest; it shapes itself before one in the ring of sentences,
it is seen between the lines&mdash;like the progress of a traveller
in the jungle that may be traced by the sound of the <i>parang</i> chopping
the swaying creepers, while the man himself is glimpsed, now and then,
indistinct and passing between the trees.&nbsp; Thus in his very vagueness
of appearance, the writer seen through the leaves of his book becomes
a fascinating companion in a land of fascination.</p>
<p>It is when dealing with the aspects of nature that Mr. Hugh Clifford
is most convincing.&nbsp; He looks upon them lovingly, for the land
is &ldquo;very dear to him,&rdquo; and he records his cherished impressions
so that the forest, the great flood, the jungle, the rapid river, and
the menacing rock dwell in the memory of the reader long after the book
is closed.&nbsp; He does not say anything, in so many words, of his
affection for those who live amid the scenes he describes so well, but
his humanity is large enough to pardon us if we suspect him of such
a rare weakness.&nbsp; In his preface he expresses the regret at not
having the gifts (whatever they may be) of the kailyard school, or&mdash;looking
up to a very different plane&mdash;the genius of Mr. Barrie.&nbsp; He
has, however, gifts of his own, and his genius has served his country
and his fortunes in another direction.&nbsp; Yet it is when attempting
what he professes himself unable to do, in telling us the simple story
of &Ucirc;mat, the punkah-puller, with unaffected simplicity and half-concealed
tenderness, that he comes nearest to artistic achievement.</p>
<p>Each study in this volume presents some idea, illustrated by a fact
told without artifice, but with an elective sureness of knowledge.&nbsp;
The story of Tukang Burok&rsquo;s love, related in the old man&rsquo;s
own words, conveys the very breath of Malay thought and speech.&nbsp;
In &ldquo;His Little Bill,&rdquo; the coolie, Lim Teng Wah, facing his
debtor, stands very distinct before us, an insignificant and tragic
victim of fate with whom he had quarrelled to the death over a matter
of seven dollars and sixty-eight cents.&nbsp; The story of &ldquo;The
Schooner with a Past&rdquo; may be heard, from the Straits eastward,
with many variations.&nbsp; Out in the Pacific the schooner becomes
a cutter, and the pearl-divers are replaced by the Black-birds of the
Labour Trade.&nbsp; But Mr. Hugh Clifford&rsquo;s variation is very
good.&nbsp; There is a passage in it&mdash;a trifle&mdash;just the diver
as seen coming up from the depths, that in its dozen lines or so attains
to distinct artistic value.&nbsp; And, scattered through the book, there
are many other passages of almost equal descriptive excellence.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, to apply artistic standards to this book would be a
fundamental error in appreciation.&nbsp; Like faith, enthusiasm, or
heroism, art veils part of the truth of life to make the rest appear
more splendid, inspiring, or sinister.&nbsp; And this book is only truth,
interesting and futile, truth unadorned, simple and straightforward.&nbsp;
The Resident of Pahang has the devoted friendship of &Ucirc;mat, the
punkah-puller, he has an individual faculty of vision, a large sympathy,
and the scrupulous consciousness of the good and evil in his hands.&nbsp;
He may as well rest content with such gifts.&nbsp; One cannot expect
to be, at the same time, a ruler of men and an irreproachable player
on the flute.</p>
<h3>A HAPPY WANDERER&mdash;1910</h3>
<p>Converts are interesting people.&nbsp; Most of us, if you will pardon
me for betraying the universal secret, have, at some time or other,
discovered in ourselves a readiness to stray far, ever so far, on the
wrong road.&nbsp; And what did we do in our pride and our cowardice?&nbsp;
Casting fearful glances and waiting for a dark moment, we buried our
discovery discreetly, and kept on in the old direction, on that old,
beaten track we have not had courage enough to leave, and which we perceive
now more clearly than before to be but the arid way of the grave.</p>
<p>The convert, the man capable of grace (I am speaking here in a secular
sense), is not discreet.&nbsp; His pride is of another kind; he jumps
gladly off the track&mdash;the touch of grace is mostly sudden&mdash;and
facing about in a new direction may even attain the illusion of having
turned his back on Death itself.</p>
<p>Some converts have, indeed, earned immortality by their exquisite
indiscretion.&nbsp; The most illustrious example of a convert, that
Flower of chivalry, Don Quixote de la Mancha, remains for all the world
the only genuine immortal hidalgo.&nbsp; The delectable Knight of Spain
became converted, as you know, from the ways of a small country squire
to an imperative faith in a tender and sublime mission.&nbsp; Forthwith
he was beaten with sticks and in due course shut up in a wooden cage
by the Barber and the Priest, the fit ministers of a justly shocked
social order.&nbsp; I do not know if it has occurred to anybody yet
to shut up Mr. Luffmann in a wooden cage. <a name="citation4"></a><a href="#footnote4">{4}</a>&nbsp;
I do not raise the point because I wish him any harm.&nbsp; Quite the
contrary.&nbsp; I am a humane person.&nbsp; Let him take it as the highest
praise&mdash;but I must say that he richly deserves that sort of attention.</p>
<p>On the other hand I would not have him unduly puffed up with the
pride of the exalted association.&nbsp; The grave wisdom, the admirable
amenity, the serene grace of the secular patron-saint of all mortals
converted to noble visions are not his.&nbsp; Mr. Luffmann has no mission.&nbsp;
He is no Knight sublimely Errant.&nbsp; But he is an excellent Vagabond.&nbsp;
He is full of merit.&nbsp; That peripatetic guide, philosopher and friend
of all nations, Mr. Roosevelt, would promptly excommunicate him with
a big stick.&nbsp; The truth is that the ex-autocrat of all the States
does not like rebels against the sullen order of our universe.&nbsp;
Make the best of it or perish&mdash;he cries.&nbsp; A sane lineal successor
of the Barber and the Priest, and a sagacious political heir of the
incomparable Sancho Panza (another great Governor), that distinguished
litt&eacute;rateur has no mercy for dreamers.&nbsp; And our author happens
to be a man of (you may trace them in his books) some rather fine reveries.</p>
<p>Every convert begins by being a rebel, and I do not see myself how
any mercy can possibly be extended to Mr. Luffmann.&nbsp; He is a convert
from the creed of strenuous life.&nbsp; For this renegade the body is
of little account; to him work appears criminal when it suppresses the
demands of the inner life; while he was young he did grind virtuously
at the sacred handle, and now, he says, he has fallen into disgrace
with some people because he believes no longer in toil without end.&nbsp;
Certain respectable folk hate him&mdash;so he says&mdash;because he
dares to think that &ldquo;poetry, beauty, and the broad face of the
world are the best things to be in love with.&rdquo;&nbsp; He confesses
to loving Spain on the ground that she is &ldquo;the land of to-morrow,
and holds the gospel of never-mind.&rdquo;&nbsp; The universal striving
to push ahead he considers mere vulgar folly.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t I tell
you he was a fit subject for the cage?</p>
<p>It is a relief (we are all humane, are we not?) to discover that
this desperate character is not altogether an outcast.&nbsp; Little
girls seem to like him.&nbsp; One of them, after listening to some of
his tales, remarked to her mother, &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be lovely
if what he says were true!&rdquo;&nbsp; Here you have Woman!&nbsp; The
charming creatures will neither strain at a camel nor swallow a gnat.&nbsp;
Not publicly.&nbsp; These operations, without which the world they have
such a large share in could not go on for ten minutes, are left to us&mdash;men.&nbsp;
And then we are chided for being coarse.&nbsp; This is a refined objection
but does not seem fair.&nbsp; Another little girl&mdash;or perhaps the
same little girl&mdash;wrote to him in Cordova, &ldquo;I hope Poste-Restante
is a nice place, and that you are very comfortable.&rdquo;&nbsp; Woman
again!&nbsp; I have in my time told some stories which are (I hate false
modesty) both true and lovely.&nbsp; Yet no little girl ever wrote to
me in kindly terms.&nbsp; And why?&nbsp; Simply because I am not enough
of a Vagabond.&nbsp; The dear despots of the fireside have a weakness
for lawless characters.&nbsp; This is amiable, but does not seem rational.</p>
<p>Being Quixotic, Mr. Luffmann is no Impressionist.&nbsp; He is far
too earnest in his heart, and not half sufficiently precise in his style
to be that.&nbsp; But he is an excellent narrator.&nbsp; More than any
Vagabond I have ever met, he knows what he is about.&nbsp; There is
not one of his quiet days which is dull.&nbsp; You will find in them
a love-story not made up, the <i>coup-de-foudre</i>, the lightning-stroke
of Spanish love; and you will marvel how a spell so sudden and vehement
can be at the same time so tragically delicate.&nbsp; You will find
there landladies devoured with jealousy, astute housekeepers, delightful
boys, wise peasants, touchy shopkeepers, all the <i>cosas de Espa&ntilde;a</i>&mdash;and,
in addition, the pale girl Rosario.&nbsp; I recommend that pathetic
and silent victim of fate to your benevolent compassion.&nbsp; You will
find in his pages the humours of starving workers of the soil, the vision
among the mountains of an exulting mad spirit in a mighty body, and
many other visions worthy of attention.&nbsp; And they are exact visions,
for this idealist is no visionary.&nbsp; He is in sympathy with suffering
mankind, and has a grasp on real human affairs.&nbsp; I mean the great
and pitiful affairs concerned with bread, love, and the obscure, unexpressed
needs which drive great crowds to prayer in the holy places of the earth.</p>
<p>But I like his conception of what a &ldquo;quiet&rdquo; life is like!&nbsp;
His quiet days require no fewer than forty-two of the forty-nine provinces
of Spain to take their ease in.&nbsp; For his unquiet days, I presume,
the seven&mdash;or is it nine?&mdash;crystal spheres of Alexandrian
cosmogony would afford, but a wretchedly straitened space.&nbsp; A most
unconventional thing is his notion of quietness.&nbsp; One would take
it as a joke; only that, perchance, to the author of <i>Quiet Days in
Spain</i> all days may seem quiet, because, a courageous convert, he
is now at peace with himself.</p>
<p>How better can we take leave of this interesting Vagabond than with
the road salutation of passing wayfarers: &ldquo;And on you be peace!
. . . You have chosen your ideal, and it is a good choice.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
nothing like giving up one&rsquo;s life to an unselfish passion.&nbsp;
Let the rich and the powerful of this globe preach their sound gospel
of palpable progress.&nbsp; The part of the ideal you embrace is the
better one, if only in its illusions.&nbsp; No great passion can be
barren.&nbsp; May a world of gracious and poignant images attend the
lofty solitude of your renunciation!&rdquo;</p>
<h3>THE LIFE BEYOND&mdash;1910</h3>
<p>You have no doubt noticed that certain books produce a sort of physical
effect on one&mdash;mostly an audible effect.&nbsp; I am not alluding
here to Blue books or to books of statistics.&nbsp; The effect of these
is simply exasperating and no more.&nbsp; No! the books I have in mind
are just the common books of commerce you and I read when we have five
minutes to spare, the usual hired books published by ordinary publishers,
printed by ordinary printers, and censored (when they happen to be novels)
by the usual circulating libraries, the guardians of our firesides,
whose names are household words within the four seas.</p>
<p>To see the fair and the brave of this free country surrendering themselves
with unbounded trust to the direction of the circulating libraries is
very touching.&nbsp; It is even, in a sense, a beautiful spectacle,
because, as you know, humility is a rare and fragrant virtue; and what
can be more humble than to surrender your morals and your intellect
to the judgment of one of your tradesmen?&nbsp; I suppose that there
are some very perfect people who allow the Army and Navy Stores to censor
their diet.&nbsp; So much merit, however, I imagine, is not frequently
met with here below.&nbsp; The flesh, alas! is weak, and&mdash;from
a certain point of view&mdash;so important!</p>
<p>A superficial person might be rendered miserable by the simple question:
What would become of us if the circulating libraries ceased to exist?&nbsp;
It is a horrid and almost indelicate supposition, but let us be brave
and face the truth.&nbsp; On this earth of ours nothing lasts.&nbsp;
<i>Tout passe, tout casse, tout lasse</i>.&nbsp; Imagine the utter wreck
overtaking the morals of our beautiful country-houses should the circulating
libraries suddenly die!&nbsp; But pray do not shudder.&nbsp; There is
no occasion.</p>
<p>Their spirit shall survive.&nbsp; I declare this from inward conviction,
and also from scientific information received lately.&nbsp; For observe:
the circulating libraries are human institutions.&nbsp; I beg you to
follow me closely.&nbsp; They are human institutions, and being human,
they are not animal, and, therefore, they are spiritual.&nbsp; Thus,
any man with enough money to take a shop, stock his shelves, and pay
for advertisements shall be able to evoke the pure and censorious spectre
of the circulating libraries whenever his own commercial spirit moves
him.</p>
<p>For, and this is the information alluded to above, Science, having
in its infinite wanderings run up against various wonders and mysteries,
is apparently willing now to allow a spiritual quality to man and, I
conclude, to all his works as well.</p>
<p>I do not know exactly what this &ldquo;Science&rdquo; may be; and
I do not think that anybody else knows; but that is the information
stated shortly.&nbsp; It is contained in a book reposing under my thoughtful
eyes. <a name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5">{5}</a>&nbsp; I know
it is not a censored book, because I can see for myself that it is not
a novel.&nbsp; The author, on his side, warns me that it is not philosophy,
that it is not metaphysics, that it is not natural science.&nbsp; After
this comprehensive warning, the definition of the book becomes, you
will admit, a pretty hard nut to crack.</p>
<p>But meantime let us return for a moment to my opening remark about
the physical effect of some common, hired books.&nbsp; A few of them
(not necessarily books of verse) are melodious; the music some others
make for you as you read has the disagreeable emphasis of a barrel-organ;
the tinkling-cymbals book (it was not written by a humorist) I only
met once.&nbsp; But there is infinite variety in the noises books do
make.&nbsp; I have now on my shelves a book apparently of the most valuable
kind which, before I have read half-a-dozen lines, begins to make a
noise like a buzz-saw.&nbsp; I am inconsolable; I shall never, I fear,
discover what it is all about, for the buzzing covers the words, and
at every try I am absolutely forced to give it up ere the end of the
page is reached.</p>
<p>The book, however, which I have found so difficult to define, is
by no means noisy.&nbsp; As a mere piece of writing it may be described
as being breathless itself and taking the reader&rsquo;s breath away,
not by the magnitude of its message but by a sort of anxious volubility
in the delivery.&nbsp; The constantly elusive argument and the illustrative
quotations go on without a single reflective pause.&nbsp; For this reason
alone the reading of that work is a fatiguing process.</p>
<p>The author himself (I use his own words) &ldquo;suspects&rdquo; that
what he has written &ldquo;may be theology after all.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
may be.&nbsp; It is not my place either to allay or to confirm the author&rsquo;s
suspicion of his own work.&nbsp; But I will state its main thesis: &ldquo;That
science regarded in the gross dictates the spirituality of man and strongly
implies a spiritual destiny for individual human beings.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This means: Existence after Death&mdash;that is, Immortality.</p>
<p>To find out its value you must go to the book.&nbsp; But I will observe
here that an Immortality liable at any moment to betray itself fatuously
by the forcible incantations of Mr. Stead or Professor Crookes is scarcely
worth having.&nbsp; Can you imagine anything more squalid than an Immortality
at the beck and call of Eusapia Palladino?&nbsp; That woman lives on
the top floor of a Neapolitan house, and gets our poor, pitiful, august
dead, flesh of our flesh, bone of our bone, spirit of our spirit, who
have loved, suffered and died, as we must love, suffer, and die&mdash;she
gets them to beat tambourines in a corner and protrude shadowy limbs
through a curtain.&nbsp; This is particularly horrible, because, if
one had to put one&rsquo;s faith in these things one could not even
die safely from disgust, as one would long to do.</p>
<p>And to believe that these manifestations, which the author evidently
takes for modern miracles, will stay our tottering faith; to believe
that the new psychology has, only the other day, discovered man to be
a &ldquo;spiritual mystery,&rdquo; is really carrying humility towards
that universal provider, Science, too far.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>We moderns have complicated our old perplexities to the point of
absurdity; our perplexities older than religion itself.&nbsp; It is
not for nothing that for so many centuries the priest, mounting the
steps of the altar, murmurs, &ldquo;Why art thou sad, my soul, and why
dost thou trouble me?&rdquo;&nbsp; Since the day of Creation two veiled
figures, Doubt and Melancholy, are pacing endlessly in the sunshine
of the world.&nbsp; What humanity needs is not the promise of scientific
immortality, but compassionate pity in this life and infinite mercy
on the Day of Judgment.</p>
<p>And, for the rest, during this transient hour of our pilgrimage,
we may well be content to repeat the Invocation of Sar Peladan.&nbsp;
Sar Peladan was an occultist, a seer, a modern magician.&nbsp; He believed
in astrology, in the spirits of the air, in elves; he was marvellously
and deliciously absurd.&nbsp; Incidentally he wrote some incomprehensible
poems and a few pages of harmonious prose, for, you must know, &ldquo;a
magician is nothing else but a great harmonist.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here are
some eight lines of the magnificent Invocation.&nbsp; Let me, however,
warn you, strictly between ourselves, that my translation is execrable.&nbsp;
I am sorry to say I am no magician.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Nature, indulgent Mother, forgive!&nbsp; Open your arms
to the son, prodigal and weary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have attempted to tear asunder the veil you have hung to
conceal from us the pain of life, and I have been wounded by the mystery.

Faust, regretting already the simple life, the life of the heart, I
come back to you repentant, reconciled, O gentle deceiver!&rdquo;</p>
<h3>THE ASCENDING EFFORT&mdash;1910</h3>
<p>Much good paper has been lamentably wasted to prove that science
has destroyed, that it is destroying, or, some day, may destroy poetry.&nbsp;
Meantime, unblushing, unseen, and often unheard, the guileless poets
have gone on singing in a sweet strain.&nbsp; How they dare do the impossible
and virtually forbidden thing is a cause for wonder but not for legislation.&nbsp;
Not yet.&nbsp; We are at present too busy reforming the silent burglar
and planning concerts to soothe the savage breast of the yelling hooligan.&nbsp;
As somebody&mdash;perhaps a publisher&mdash;said lately: &ldquo;Poetry
is of no account now-a-days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it is not totally neglected.&nbsp; Those persons with gold-rimmed
spectacles whose usual occupation is to spy upon the obvious have remarked
audibly (on several occasions) that poetry has so far not given to science
any acknowledgment worthy of its distinguished position in the popular
mind.&nbsp; Except that Tennyson looked down the throat of a foxglove,
that Erasmus Darwin wrote <i>The Loves of the Plants</i> and a scoffer
<i>The Loves of the Triangles</i>, poets have been supposed to be indecorously
blind to the progress of science.&nbsp; What tribute, for instance,
has poetry paid to electricity?&nbsp; All I can remember on the spur
of the moment is Mr. Arthur Symons&rsquo; line about arc lamps: &ldquo;Hung
with the globes of some unnatural fruit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Commerce and Manufacture praise on every hand in their not mute but
inarticulate way the glories of science.&nbsp; Poetry does not play
its part.&nbsp; Behold John Keats, skilful with the surgeon&rsquo;s
knife; but when he writes poetry his inspiration is not from the operating
table.&nbsp; Here I am reminded, though, of a modern instance to the
contrary in prose.&nbsp; Mr. H. G. Wells, who, as far as I know, has
never written a line of verse, was inspired a few years ago to write
a short story, <i>Under the Knife</i>.&nbsp; Out of a clock-dial, a
brass rod, and a whiff of chloroform, he has conjured for us a sensation
of space and eternity, evoked the face of the Unknowable, and an awesome,
august voice, like the voice of the Judgment Day; a great voice, perhaps
the voice of science itself, uttering the words: &ldquo;There shall
be no more pain!&rdquo;&nbsp; I advise you to look up that story, so
human and so intimate, because Mr. Wells, the writer of prose whose
amazing inventiveness we all know, remains a poet even in his most perverse
moments of scorn for things as they are.&nbsp; His poetic imagination
is sometimes even greater than his inventiveness, I am not afraid to
say.&nbsp; But, indeed, imaginative faculty would make any man a poet&mdash;were
he born without tongue for speech and without hands to seize his fancy
and fasten her down to a wretched piece of paper.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>The book <a name="citation6"></a><a href="#footnote6">{6}</a> which
in the course of the last few days I have opened and shut several times
is not imaginative.&nbsp; But, on the other hand, it is not a dumb book,
as some are.&nbsp; It has even a sort of sober and serious eloquence,
reminding us that not poetry alone is at fault in this matter.&nbsp;
Mr. Bourne begins his <i>Ascending Effort</i> with a remark by Sir Francis
Galton upon Eugenics that &ldquo;if the principles he was advocating
were to become effective they must be introduced into the national conscience,
like a new religion.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Introduced&rdquo; suggests
compulsory vaccination.&nbsp; Mr. Bourne, who is not a theologian, wishes
to league together not science and religion, but science and the arts.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The intoxicating power of art,&rdquo; he thinks, is the very
thing needed to give the desired effect to the doctrines of science.&nbsp;
In uninspired phrase he points to the arts playing once upon a time
a part in &ldquo;popularising the Christian tenets.&rdquo;&nbsp; With
painstaking fervour as great as the fervour of prophets, but not so
persuasive, he foresees the arts some day popularising science.&nbsp;
Until that day dawns, science will continue to be lame and poetry blind.&nbsp;
He himself cannot smooth or even point out the way, though he thinks
that &ldquo;a really prudent people would be greedy of beauty,&rdquo;
and their public authorities &ldquo;as careful of the sense of comfort
as of sanitation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the writer of those remarkable rustic note-books, <i>The Bettesworth
Book</i> and <i>Memoirs of a Surrey Labourer</i>, the author has a claim
upon our attention.&nbsp; But his seriousness, his patience, his almost
touching sincerity, can only command the respect of his readers and
nothing more.&nbsp; He is obsessed by science, haunted and shadowed
by it, until he has been bewildered into awe.&nbsp; He knows, indeed,
that art owes its triumphs and its subtle influence to the fact that
it issues straight from our organic vitality, and is a movement of life-cells
with their matchless unintellectual knowledge.&nbsp; But the fact that
poetry does not seem obviously in love with science has never made him
doubt whether it may not be an argument against his haste to see the
marriage ceremony performed amid public rejoicings.</p>
<p>Many a man has heard or read and believes that the earth goes round
the sun; one small blob of mud among several others, spinning ridiculously
with a waggling motion like a top about to fall.&nbsp; This is the Copernican
system, and the man believes in the system without often knowing as
much about it as its name.&nbsp; But while watching a sunset he sheds
his belief; he sees the sun as a small and useful object, the servant
of his needs and the witness of his ascending effort, sinking slowly
behind a range of mountains, and then he holds the system of Ptolemy.&nbsp;
He holds it without knowing it.&nbsp; In the same way a poet hears,
reads, and believes a thousand undeniable truths which have not yet
got into his blood, nor will do after reading Mr. Bourne&rsquo;s book;
he writes, therefore, as if neither truths nor book existed.&nbsp; Life
and the arts follow dark courses, and will not turn aside to the brilliant
arc-lights of science.&nbsp; Some day, without a doubt,&mdash;and it
may be a consolation to Mr. Bourne to know it&mdash;fully informed critics
will point out that Mr. Davies&rsquo;s poem on a dark woman combing
her hair must have been written after the invasion of appendicitis,
and that Mr. Yeats&rsquo;s &ldquo;Had I the heaven&rsquo;s embroidered
cloths&rdquo; came before radium was quite unnecessarily dragged out
of its respectable obscurity in pitchblende to upset the venerable (and
comparatively naive) chemistry of our young days.</p>
<p>There are times when the tyranny of science and the cant of science
are alarming, but there are other times when they are entertaining&mdash;and
this is one of them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Many a man prides himself&rdquo; says
Mr. Bourne, &ldquo;on his piety or his views of art, whose whole range
of ideas, could they be investigated, would be found ordinary, if not
base, because they have been adopted in compliance with some external
persuasion or to serve some timid purpose instead of proceeding authoritatively
from the living selection of his hereditary taste.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
extract is a fair sample of the book&rsquo;s thought and of its style.&nbsp;
But Mr. Bourne seems to forget that &ldquo;persuasion&rdquo; is a vain
thing.&nbsp; The appreciation of great art comes from within.</p>
<p>It is but the merest justice to say that the transparent honesty
of Mr. Bourne&rsquo;s purpose is undeniable.&nbsp; But the whole book
is simply an earnest expression of a pious wish; and, like the generality
of pious wishes, this one seems of little dynamic value&mdash;besides
being impracticable.</p>
<p>Yes, indeed.&nbsp; Art has served Religion; artists have found the
most exalted inspiration in Christianity; but the light of Transfiguration
which has illuminated the profoundest mysteries of our sinful souls
is not the light of the generating stations, which exposes the depths
of our infatuation where our mere cleverness is permitted for a while
to grope for the unessential among invincible shadows.</p>
<h3>THE CENSOR OF PLAYS&mdash;AN APPRECIATION&mdash;1907</h3>
<p>A couple of years ago I was moved to write a one-act play&mdash;and
I lived long enough to accomplish the task.&nbsp; We live and learn.&nbsp;
When the play was finished I was informed that it had to be licensed
for performance.&nbsp; Thus I learned of the existence of the Censor
of Plays.&nbsp; I may say without vanity that I am intelligent enough
to have been astonished by that piece of information: for facts must
stand in some relation to time and space, and I was aware of being in
England&mdash;in the twentieth-century England.&nbsp; The fact did not
fit the date and the place.&nbsp; That was my first thought.&nbsp; It
was, in short, an improper fact.&nbsp; I beg you to believe that I am
writing in all seriousness and am weighing my words scrupulously.</p>
<p>Therefore I don&rsquo;t say inappropriate.&nbsp; I say improper&mdash;that
is: something to be ashamed of.&nbsp; And at first this impression was
confirmed by the obscurity in which the figure embodying this after
all considerable fact had its being.&nbsp; The Censor of Plays!&nbsp;
His name was not in the mouths of all men.&nbsp; Far from it.&nbsp;
He seemed stealthy and remote.&nbsp; There was about that figure the
scent of the far East, like the peculiar atmosphere of a Mandarin&rsquo;s
back yard, and the mustiness of the Middle Ages, that epoch when mankind
tried to stand still in a monstrous illusion of final certitude attained
in morals, intellect and conscience.</p>
<p>It was a disagreeable impression.&nbsp; But I reflected that probably
the censorship of plays was an inactive monstrosity; not exactly a survival,
since it seemed obviously at variance with the genius of the people,
but an heirloom of past ages, a bizarre and imported curiosity preserved
because of that weakness one has for one&rsquo;s old possessions apart
from any intrinsic value; one more object of exotic <i>virt&ugrave;</i>,
an Oriental <i>potiche</i>, a <i>magot chinois</i> conceived by a childish
and extravagant imagination, but allowed to stand in stolid impotence
in the twilight of the upper shelf.</p>
<p>Thus I quieted my uneasy mind.&nbsp; Its uneasiness had nothing to
do with the fate of my one-act play.&nbsp; The play was duly produced,
and an exceptionally intelligent audience stared it coldly off the boards.&nbsp;
It ceased to exist.&nbsp; It was a fair and open execution.&nbsp; But
having survived the freezing atmosphere of that auditorium I continued
to exist, labouring under no sense of wrong.&nbsp; I was not pleased,
but I was content.&nbsp; I was content to accept the verdict of a free
and independent public, judging after its conscience the work of its
free, independent and conscientious servant&mdash;the artist.</p>
<p>Only thus can the dignity of artistic servitude be preserved&mdash;not
to speak of the bare existence of the artist and the self-respect of
the man.&nbsp; I shall say nothing of the self-respect of the public.&nbsp;
To the self-respect of the public the present appeal against the censorship
is being made and I join in it with all my heart.</p>
<p>For I have lived long enough to learn that the monstrous and outlandish
figure, the <i>magot chinois</i> whom I believed to be but a memorial
of our forefathers&rsquo; mental aberration, that grotesque <i>potiche</i>,
works!&nbsp; The absurd and hollow creature of clay seems to be alive
with a sort of (surely) unconscious life worthy of its traditions.&nbsp;
It heaves its stomach, it rolls its eyes, it brandishes a monstrous
arm: and with the censorship, like a Bravo of old Venice with a more
carnal weapon, stabs its victim from behind in the twilight of its upper
shelf.&nbsp; Less picturesque than the Venetian in cloak and mask, less
estimable, too, in this, that the assassin plied his moral trade at
his own risk deriving no countenance from the powers of the Republic,
it stands more malevolent, inasmuch that the Bravo striking in the dusk
killed but the body, whereas the grotesque thing nodding its mandarin
head may in its absurd unconsciousness strike down at any time the spirit
of an honest, of an artistic, perhaps of a sublime creation.</p>
<p>This Chinese monstrosity, disguised in the trousers of the Western
Barbarian and provided by the State with the immortal Mr. Stiggins&rsquo;s
plug hat and umbrella, is with us.&nbsp; It is an office.&nbsp; An office
of trust.&nbsp; And from time to time there is found an official to
fill it.&nbsp; He is a public man.&nbsp; The least prominent of public
men, the most unobtrusive, the most obscure if not the most modest.</p>
<p>But however obscure, a public man may be told the truth if only once
in his life.&nbsp; His office flourishes in the shade; not in the rustic
shade beloved of the violet but in the muddled twilight of mind, where
tyranny of every sort flourishes.&nbsp; Its holder need not have either
brain or heart, no sight, no taste, no imagination, not even bowels
of compassion.&nbsp; He needs not these things.&nbsp; He has power.&nbsp;
He can kill thought, and incidentally truth, and incidentally beauty,
providing they seek to live in a dramatic form.&nbsp; He can do it,
without seeing, without understanding, without feeling anything; out
of mere stupid suspicion, as an irresponsible Roman C&aelig;sar could
kill a senator.&nbsp; He can do that and there is no one to say him
nay.&nbsp; He may call his cook (Moli&egrave;re used to do that) from
below and give her five acts to judge every morning as a matter of constant
practice and still remain the unquestioned destroyer of men&rsquo;s
honest work.&nbsp; He may have a glass too much.&nbsp; This accident
has happened to persons of unimpeachable morality&mdash;to gentlemen.&nbsp;
He may suffer from spells of imbecility like Clodius.&nbsp; He may .
. . what might he not do!&nbsp; I tell you he is the C&aelig;sar of
the dramatic world.&nbsp; There has been since the Roman Principate
nothing in the way of irresponsible power to compare with the office
of the Censor of Plays.</p>
<p>Looked at in this way it has some grandeur, something colossal in
the odious and the absurd.&nbsp; This figure in whose power it is to
suppress an intellectual conception&mdash;to kill thought (a dream for
a mad brain, my masters!)&mdash;seems designed in a spirit of bitter
comedy to bring out the greatness of a Philistine&rsquo;s conceit and
his moral cowardice.</p>
<p>But this is England in the twentieth century, and one wonders that
there can be found a man courageous enough to occupy the post.&nbsp;
It is a matter for meditation.&nbsp; Having given it a few minutes I
come to the conclusion in the serenity of my heart and the peace of
my conscience that he must be either an extreme megalomaniac or an utterly
unconscious being.</p>
<p>He must be unconscious.&nbsp; It is one of the qualifications for
his magistracy.&nbsp; Other qualifications are equally easy.&nbsp; He
must have done nothing, expressed nothing, imagined nothing.&nbsp; He
must be obscure, insignificant and mediocre&mdash;in thought, act, speech
and sympathy.&nbsp; He must know nothing of art, of life&mdash;and of
himself.&nbsp; For if he did he would not dare to be what he is.&nbsp;
Like that much questioned and mysterious bird, the phoenix, he sits
amongst the cold ashes of his predecessor upon the altar of morality,
alone of his kind in the sight of wondering generations.</p>
<p>And I will end with a quotation reproducing not perhaps the exact
words but the true spirit of a lofty conscience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Often when sitting down to write the notice of a play, especially
when I felt it antagonistic to my canons of art, to my tastes or my
convictions, I hesitated in the fear lest my conscientious blame might
check the development of a great talent, my sincere judgment condemn
a worthy mind.&nbsp; With the pen poised in my hand I hesitated, whispering
to myself &lsquo;What if I were perchance doing my part in killing a
masterpiece.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such were the lofty scruples of M. Jules Lema&icirc;tre&mdash;dramatist
and dramatic critic, a great citizen and a high magistrate in the Republic
of Letters; a Censor of Plays exercising his august office openly in
the light of day, with the authority of a European reputation.&nbsp;
But then M. Jules Lema&icirc;tre is a man possessed of wisdom, of great
fame, of a fine conscience&mdash;not an obscure hollow Chinese monstrosity
ornamented with Mr. Stiggins&rsquo;s plug hat and cotton umbrella by
its anxious grandmother&mdash;the State.</p>
<p>Frankly, is it not time to knock the improper object off its shelf?&nbsp;
It has stood too long there.&nbsp; Hatched in Pekin (I should say) by
some Board of Respectable Rites, the little caravan monster has come
to us by way of Moscow&mdash;I suppose.&nbsp; It is outlandish.&nbsp;
It is not venerable.&nbsp; It does not belong here.&nbsp; Is it not
time to knock it off its dark shelf with some implement appropriate
to its worth and status?&nbsp; With an old broom handle for instance.</p>
<h2>PART II&mdash;LIFE</h2>
<h3>AUTOCRACY AND WAR&mdash;1905</h3>
<p>From the firing of the first shot on the banks of the Sha-ho, the
fate of the great battle of the Russo-Japanese war hung in the balance
for more than a fortnight.&nbsp; The famous three-day battles, for which
history has reserved the recognition of special pages, sink into insignificance
before the struggles in Manchuria engaging half a million men on fronts
of sixty miles, struggles lasting for weeks, flaming up fiercely and
dying away from sheer exhaustion, to flame up again in desperate persistence,
and end&mdash;as we have seen them end more than once&mdash;not from
the victor obtaining a crushing advantage, but through the mortal weariness
of the combatants.</p>
<p>We have seen these things, though we have seen them only in the cold,
silent, colourless print of books and newspapers.&nbsp; In stigmatising
the printed word as cold, silent and colourless, I have no intention
of putting a slight upon the fidelity and the talents of men who have
provided us with words to read about the battles in Manchuria.&nbsp;
I only wished to suggest that in the nature of things, the war in the
Far East has been made known to us, so far, in a grey reflection of
its terrible and monotonous phases of pain, death, sickness; a reflection
seen in the perspective of thousands of miles, in the dim atmosphere
of official reticence, through the veil of inadequate words.&nbsp; Inadequate,
I say, because what had to be reproduced is beyond the common experience
of war, and our imagination, luckily for our peace of mind, has remained
a slumbering faculty, notwithstanding the din of humanitarian talk and
the real progress of humanitarian ideas.&nbsp; Direct vision of the
fact, or the stimulus of a great art, can alone make it turn and open
its eyes heavy with blessed sleep; and even there, as against the testimony
of the senses and the stirring up of emotion, that saving callousness
which reconciles us to the conditions of our existence, will assert
itself under the guise of assent to fatal necessity, or in the enthusiasm
of a purely &aelig;sthetic admiration of the rendering.&nbsp; In this
age of knowledge our sympathetic imagination, to which alone we can
look for the ultimate triumph of concord and justice, remains strangely
impervious to information, however correctly and even picturesquely
conveyed.&nbsp; As to the vaunted eloquence of a serried array of figures,
it has all the futility of precision without force.&nbsp; It is the
exploded superstition of enthusiastic statisticians.&nbsp; An over-worked
horse falling in front of our windows, a man writhing under a cart-wheel
in the streets awaken more genuine emotion, more horror, pity, and indignation
than the stream of reports, appalling in their monotony, of tens of
thousands of decaying bodies tainting the air of the Manchurian plains,
of other tens of thousands of maimed bodies groaning in ditches, crawling
on the frozen ground, filling the field hospitals; of the hundreds of
thousands of survivors no less pathetic and even more tragic in being
left alive by fate to the wretched exhaustion of their pitiful toil.</p>
<p>An early Victorian, or perhaps a pre-Victorian, sentimentalist, looking
out of an upstairs window, I believe, at a street&mdash;perhaps Fleet
Street itself&mdash;full of people, is reported, by an admiring friend,
to have wept for joy at seeing so much life.&nbsp; These arcadian tears,
this facile emotion worthy of the golden age, comes to us from the past,
with solemn approval, after the close of the Napoleonic wars and before
the series of sanguinary surprises held in reserve by the nineteenth
century for our hopeful grandfathers.&nbsp; We may well envy them their
optimism of which this anecdote of an amiable wit and sentimentalist
presents an extreme instance, but still, a true instance, and worthy
of regard in the spontaneous testimony to that trust in the life of
the earth, triumphant at last in the felicity of her children.&nbsp;
Moreover, the psychology of individuals, even in the most extreme instances,
reflects the general effect of the fears and hopes of its time.&nbsp;
Wept for joy!&nbsp; I should think that now, after eighty years, the
emotion would be of a sterner sort.&nbsp; One could not imagine anybody
shedding tears of joy at the sight of much life in a street, unless,
perhaps, he were an enthusiastic officer of a general staff or a popular
politician, with a career yet to make.&nbsp; And hardly even that.&nbsp;
In the case of the first tears would be unprofessional, and a stern
repression of all signs of joy at the provision of so much food for
powder more in accord with the rules of prudence; the joy of the second
would be checked before it found issue in weeping by anxious doubts
as to the soundness of these electors&rsquo; views upon the question
of the hour, and the fear of missing the consensus of their votes.</p>
<p>No!&nbsp; It seems that such a tender joy would be misplaced now
as much as ever during the last hundred years, to go no further back.&nbsp;
The end of the eighteenth century was, too, a time of optimism and of
dismal mediocrity in which the French Revolution exploded like a bombshell.&nbsp;
In its lurid blaze the insufficiency of Europe, the inferiority of minds,
of military and administrative systems, stood exposed with pitiless
vividness.&nbsp; And there is but little courage in saying at this time
of the day that the glorified French Revolution itself, except for its
destructive force, was in essentials a mediocre phenomenon.&nbsp; The
parentage of that great social and political upheaval was intellectual,
the idea was elevated; but it is the bitter fate of any idea to lose
its royal form and power, to lose its &ldquo;virtue&rdquo; the moment
it descends from its solitary throne to work its will among the people.&nbsp;
It is a king whose destiny is never to know the obedience of his subjects
except at the cost of degradation.&nbsp; The degradation of the ideas
of freedom and justice at the root of the French Revolution is made
manifest in the person of its heir; a personality without law or faith,
whom it has been the fashion to represent as an eagle, but who was,
in truth, more like a sort of vulture preying upon the body of a Europe
which did, indeed, for some dozen of years, very much resemble a corpse.&nbsp;
The subtle and manifold influence for evil of the Napoleonic episode
as a school of violence, as a sower of national hatreds, as the direct
provocator of obscurantism and reaction, of political tyranny and injustice,
cannot well be exaggerated.</p>
<p>The nineteenth century began with wars which were the issue of a
corrupted revolution.&nbsp; It may be said that the twentieth begins
with a war which is like the explosive ferment of a moral grave, whence
may yet emerge a new political organism to take the place of a gigantic
and dreaded phantom.&nbsp; For a hundred years the ghost of Russian
might, overshadowing with its fantastic bulk the councils of Central
and Western Europe, sat upon the gravestone of autocracy, cutting off
from air, from light, from all knowledge of themselves and of the world,
the buried millions of Russian people.&nbsp; Not the most determined
cockney sentimentalist could have had the heart to weep for joy at the
thought of its teeming numbers!&nbsp; And yet they were living, they
are alive yet, since, through the mist of print, we have seen their
blood freezing crimson upon the snow of the squares and streets of St.
Petersburg; since their generations born in the grave are yet alive
enough to fill the ditches and cover the fields of Manchuria with their
torn limbs; to send up from the frozen ground of battlefields a chorus
of groans calling for vengeance from Heaven; to kill and retreat, or
kill and advance, without intermission or rest for twenty hours, for
fifty hours, for whole weeks of fatigue, hunger, cold, and murder&mdash;till
their ghastly labour, worthy of a place amongst the punishments of Dante&rsquo;s
Inferno, passing through the stages of courage, of fury, of hopelessness,
sinks into the night of crazy despair.</p>
<p>It seems that in both armies many men are driven beyond the bounds
of sanity by the stress of moral and physical misery.&nbsp; Great numbers
of soldiers and regimental officers go mad as if by way of protest against
the peculiar sanity of a state of war: mostly among the Russians, of
course.&nbsp; The Japanese have in their favour the tonic effect of
success; and the innate gentleness of their character stands them in
good stead.&nbsp; But the Japanese grand army has yet another advantage
in this nerve-destroying contest, which for endless, arduous toil of
killing surpasses all the wars of history.&nbsp; It has a base for its
operations; a base of a nature beyond the concern of the many books
written upon the so-called art of war, which, considered by itself,
purely as an exercise of human ingenuity, is at best only a thing of
well-worn, simple artifices.&nbsp; The Japanese army has for its base
a reasoned conviction; it has behind it the profound belief in the right
of a logical necessity to be appeased at the cost of so much blood and
treasure.&nbsp; And in that belief, whether well or ill founded, that
army stands on the high ground of conscious assent, shouldering deliberately
the burden of a long-tried faithfulness.&nbsp; The other people (since
each people is an army nowadays), torn out from a miserable quietude
resembling death itself, hurled across space, amazed, without starting-point
of its own or knowledge of the aim, can feel nothing but a horror-stricken
consciousness of having mysteriously become the plaything of a black
and merciless fate.</p>
<p>The profound, the instructive nature of this war is resumed by the
memorable difference in the spiritual state of the two armies; the one
forlorn and dazed on being driven out from an abyss of mental darkness
into the red light of a conflagration, the other with a full knowledge
of its past and its future, &ldquo;finding itself&rdquo; as it were
at every step of the trying war before the eyes of an astonished world.&nbsp;
The greatness of the lesson has been dwarfed for most of us by an often
half-conscious prejudice of race-difference.&nbsp; The West having managed
to lodge its hasty foot on the neck of the East, is prone to forget
that it is from the East that the wonders of patience and wisdom have
come to a world of men who set the value of life in the power to act
rather than in the faculty of meditation.&nbsp; It has been dwarfed
by this, and it has been obscured by a cloud of considerations with
whose shaping wisdom and meditation had little or nothing to do; by
the weary platitudes on the military situation which (apart from geographical
conditions) is the same everlasting situation that has prevailed since
the times of Hannibal and Scipio, and further back yet, since the beginning
of historical record&mdash;since prehistoric times, for that matter;
by the conventional expressions of horror at the tale of maiming and
killing; by the rumours of peace with guesses more or less plausible
as to its conditions.&nbsp; All this is made legitimate by the consecrated
custom of writers in such time as this&mdash;the time of a great war.&nbsp;
More legitimate in view of the situation created in Europe are the speculations
as to the course of events after the war.&nbsp; More legitimate, but
hardly more wise than the irresponsible talk of strategy that never
changes, and of terms of peace that do not matter.</p>
<p>And above it all&mdash;unaccountably persistent&mdash;the decrepit,
old, hundred years old, spectre of Russia&rsquo;s might still faces
Europe from across the teeming graves of Russian people.&nbsp; This
dreaded and strange apparition, bristling with bayonets, armed with
chains, hung over with holy images; that something not of this world,
partaking of a ravenous ghoul, of a blind Djinn grown up from a cloud,
and of the Old Man of the Sea, still faces us with its old stupidity,
with its strange mystical arrogance, stamping its shadowy feet upon
the gravestone of autocracy already cracked beyond repair by the torpedoes
of Togo and the guns of Oyama, already heaving in the blood-soaked ground
with the first stirrings of a resurrection.</p>
<p>Never before had the Western world the opportunity to look so deep
into the black abyss which separates a soulless autocracy posing as,
and even believing itself to be, the arbiter of Europe, from the benighted,
starved souls of its people.&nbsp; This is the real object-lesson of
this war, its unforgettable information.&nbsp; And this war&rsquo;s
true mission, disengaged from the economic origins of that contest,
from doors open or shut, from the fields of Korea for Russian wheat
or Japanese rice, from the ownership of ice-free ports and the command
of the waters of the East&mdash;its true mission was to lay a ghost.&nbsp;
It has accomplished it.&nbsp; Whether Kuropatkin was incapable or unlucky,
whether or not Russia issuing next year, or the year after next, from
behind a rampart of piled-up corpses will win or lose a fresh campaign,
are minor considerations.&nbsp; The task of Japan is done, the mission
accomplished; the ghost of Russia&rsquo;s might is laid.&nbsp; Only
Europe, accustomed so long to the presence of that portent, seems unable
to comprehend that, as in the fables of our childhood, the twelve strokes
of the hour have rung, the cock has crowed, the apparition has vanished&mdash;never
to haunt again this world which has been used to gaze at it with vague
dread and many misgivings.</p>
<p>It was a fascination.&nbsp; And the hallucination still lasts as
inexplicable in its persistence as in its duration.&nbsp; It seems so
unaccountable, that the doubt arises as to the sincerity of all that
talk as to what Russia will or will not do, whether it will raise or
not another army, whether it will bury the Japanese in Manchuria under
seventy millions of sacrificed peasants&rsquo; caps (as her Press boasted
a little more than a year ago) or give up to Japan that jewel of her
crown, Saghalien, together with some other things; whether, perchance,
as an interesting alternative, it will make peace on the Amur in order
to make war beyond the Oxus.</p>
<p>All these speculations (with many others) have appeared gravely in
print; and if they have been gravely considered by only one reader out
of each hundred, there must be something subtly noxious to the human
brain in the composition of newspaper ink; or else it is that the large
page, the columns of words, the leaded headings, exalt the mind into
a state of feverish credulity.&nbsp; The printed page of the Press makes
a sort of still uproar, taking from men both the power to reflect and
the faculty of genuine feeling; leaving them only the artificially created
need of having something exciting to talk about.</p>
<p>The truth is that the Russia of our fathers, of our childhood, of
our middle-age; the testamentary Russia of Peter the Great&mdash;who
imagined that all the nations were delivered into the hand of Tsardom&mdash;can
do nothing.&nbsp; It can do nothing because it does not exist.&nbsp;
It has vanished for ever at last, and as yet there is no new Russia
to take the place of that ill-omened creation, which, being a fantasy
of a madman&rsquo;s brain, could in reality be nothing else than a figure
out of a nightmare seated upon a monument of fear and oppression.</p>
<p>The true greatness of a State does not spring from such a contemptible
source.&nbsp; It is a matter of logical growth, of faith and courage.&nbsp;
Its inspiration springs from the constructive instinct of the people,
governed by the strong hand of a collective conscience and voiced in
the wisdom and counsel of men who seldom reap the reward of gratitude.&nbsp;
Many States have been powerful, but, perhaps, none have been truly great&mdash;as
yet.&nbsp; That the position of a State in reference to the moral methods
of its development can be seen only historically, is true.&nbsp; Perhaps
mankind has not lived long enough for a comprehensive view of any particular
case.&nbsp; Perhaps no one will ever live long enough; and perhaps this
earth shared out amongst our clashing ambitions by the anxious arrangements
of statesmen will come to an end before we attain the felicity of greeting
with unanimous applause the perfect fruition of a great State.&nbsp;
It is even possible that we are destined for another sort of bliss altogether:
that sort which consists in being perpetually duped by false appearances.&nbsp;
But whatever political illusion the future may hold out to our fear
or our admiration, there will be none, it is safe to say, which in the
magnitude of anti-humanitarian effect will equal that phantom now driven
out of the world by the thunder of thousands of guns; none that in its
retreat will cling with an equally shameless sincerity to more unworthy
supports: to the moral corruption and mental darkness of slavery, to
the mere brute force of numbers.</p>
<p>This very ignominy of infatuation should make clear to men&rsquo;s
feelings and reason that the downfall of Russia&rsquo;s might is unavoidable.&nbsp;
Spectral it lived and spectral it disappears without leaving a memory
of a single generous deed, of a single service rendered&mdash;even involuntarily&mdash;to
the polity of nations.&nbsp; Other despotisms there have been, but none
whose origin was so grimly fantastic in its baseness, and the beginning
of whose end was so gruesomely ignoble.&nbsp; What is amazing is the
myth of its irresistible strength which is dying so hard.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Considered historically, Russia&rsquo;s influence in Europe seems
the most baseless thing in the world; a sort of convention invented
by diplomatists for some dark purpose of their own, one would suspect,
if the lack of grasp upon the realities of any given situation were
not the main characteristic of the management of international relations.&nbsp;
A glance back at the last hundred years shows the invariable, one may
say the logical, powerlessness of Russia.&nbsp; As a military power
it has never achieved by itself a single great thing.&nbsp; It has been
indeed able to repel an ill-considered invasion, but only by having
recourse to the extreme methods of desperation.&nbsp; In its attacks
upon its specially selected victim this giant always struck as if with
a withered right hand.&nbsp; All the campaigns against Turkey prove
this, from Potemkin&rsquo;s time to the last Eastern war in 1878, entered
upon with every advantage of a well-nursed prestige and a carefully
fostered fanaticism.&nbsp; Even the half-armed were always too much
for the might of Russia, or, rather, of the Tsardom.&nbsp; It was victorious
only against the practically disarmed, as, in regard to its ideal of
territorial expansion, a glance at a map will prove sufficiently.&nbsp;
As an ally, Russia has been always unprofitable, taking her share in
the defeats rather than in the victories of her friends, but always
pushing her own claims with the arrogance of an arbiter of military
success.&nbsp; She has been unable to help to any purpose a single principle
to hold its own, not even the principle of authority and legitimism
which Nicholas the First had declared so haughtily to rest under his
special protection; just as Nicholas the Second has tried to make the
maintenance of peace on earth his own exclusive affair.&nbsp; And the
first Nicholas was a good Russian; he held the belief in the sacredness
of his realm with such an intensity of faith that he could not survive
the first shock of doubt.&nbsp; Rightly envisaged, the Crimean war was
the end of what remained of absolutism and legitimism in Europe.&nbsp;
It threw the way open for the liberation of Italy.&nbsp; The war in
Manchuria makes an end of absolutism in Russia, whoever has got to perish
from the shock behind a rampart of dead ukases, manifestoes, and rescripts.&nbsp;
In the space of fifty years the self-appointed Apostle of Absolutism
and the self-appointed Apostle of Peace, the Augustus and the Augustulus
of the <i>r&eacute;gime</i> that was wont to speak contemptuously to
European Foreign Offices in the beautiful French phrases of Prince Gorchakov,
have fallen victims, each after his kind, to their shadowy and dreadful
familiar, to the phantom, part ghoul, part Djinn, part Old Man of the
Sea, with beak and claws and a double head, looking greedily both east
and west on the confines of two continents.</p>
<p>That nobody through all that time penetrated the true nature of the
monster it is impossible to believe.&nbsp; But of the many who must
have seen, all were either too modest, too cautious, perhaps too discreet,
to speak; or else were too insignificant to be heard or believed.&nbsp;
Yet not all.</p>
<p>In the very early sixties, Prince Bismarck, then about to leave his
post of Prussian Minister in St. Petersburg, called&mdash;so the story
goes&mdash;upon another distinguished diplomatist.&nbsp; After some
talk upon the general situation, the future Chancellor of the German
Empire remarked that it was his practice to resume the impressions he
had carried out of every country where he had made a long stay, in a
short sentence, which he caused to be engraved upon some trinket.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am leaving this country now, and this is what I bring away
from it,&rdquo; he continued, taking off his finger a new ring to show
to his colleague the inscription inside: &ldquo;La Russie, c&rsquo;est
le n&eacute;ant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prince Bismarck had the truth of the matter and was neither too modest
nor too discreet to speak out.&nbsp; Certainly he was not afraid of
not being believed.&nbsp; Yet he did not shout his knowledge from the
house-tops.&nbsp; He meant to have the phantom as his accomplice in
an enterprise which has set the clock of peace back for many a year.</p>
<p>He had his way.&nbsp; The German Empire has been an accomplished
fact for more than a third of a century&mdash;a great and dreadful legacy
left to the world by the ill-omened phantom of Russia&rsquo;s might.</p>
<p>It is that phantom which is disappearing now&mdash;unexpectedly,
astonishingly, as if by a touch of that wonderful magic for which the
East has always been famous.&nbsp; The pretence of belief in its existence
will no longer answer anybody&rsquo;s purposes (now Prince Bismarck
is dead) unless the purposes of the writers of sensational paragraphs
as to this <i>N&eacute;ant</i> making an armed descent upon the plains
of India.&nbsp; That sort of folly would be beneath notice if it did
not distract attention from the real problem created for Europe by a
war in the Far East.</p>
<p>For good or evil in the working out of her destiny, Russia is bound
to remain a <i>N&eacute;ant</i> for many long years, in a more even
than a Bismarckian sense.&nbsp; The very fear of this spectre being
gone, it behoves us to consider its legacy&mdash;the fact (no phantom
that) accomplished in Central Europe by its help and connivance.</p>
<p>The German Empire may feel at bottom the loss of an old accomplice
always amenable to the confidential whispers of a bargain; but in the
first instance it cannot but rejoice at the fundamental weakening of
a possible obstacle to its instincts of territorial expansion.&nbsp;
There is a removal of that latent feeling of restraint which the presence
of a powerful neighbour, however implicated with you in a sense of common
guilt, is bound to inspire.&nbsp; The common guilt of the two Empires
is defined precisely by their frontier line running through the Polish
provinces.&nbsp; Without indulging in excessive feelings of indignation
at that country&rsquo;s partition, or going so far as to believe&mdash;with
a late French politician&mdash;in the &ldquo;immanente justice des choses,&rdquo;
it is clear that a material situation, based upon an essentially immoral
transaction, contains the germ of fatal differences in the temperament
of the two partners in iniquity&mdash;whatever the iniquity is.&nbsp;
Germany has been the evil counsellor of Russia on all the questions
of her Polish problem.&nbsp; Always urging the adoption of the most
repressive measures with a perfectly logical duplicity, Prince Bismarck&rsquo;s
Empire has taken care to couple the neighbourly offers of military assistance
with merciless advice.&nbsp; The thought of the Polish provinces accepting
a frank reconciliation with a humanised Russia and bringing the weight
of homogeneous loyalty within a few miles of Berlin, has been always
intensely distasteful to the arrogant Germanising tendencies of the
other partner in iniquity.&nbsp; And, besides, the way to the Baltic
provinces leads over the Niemen and over the Vistula.</p>
<p>And now, when there is a possibility of serious internal disturbances
destroying the sort of order autocracy has kept in Russia, the road
over these rivers is seen wearing a more inviting aspect.&nbsp; At any
moment the pretext of armed intervention may be found in a revolutionary
outbreak provoked by Socialists, perhaps&mdash;but at any rate by the
political immaturity of the enlightened classes and by the political
barbarism of the Russian people.&nbsp; The throes of Russian resurrection
will be long and painful.&nbsp; This is not the place to speculate upon
the nature of these convulsions, but there must be some violent break-up
of the lamentable tradition, a shattering of the social, of the administrative&mdash;certainly
of the territorial&mdash;unity.</p>
<p>Voices have been heard saying that the time for reforms in Russia
is already past.&nbsp; This is the superficial view of the more profound
truth that for Russia there has never been such a time within the memory
of mankind.&nbsp; It is impossible to initiate a rational scheme of
reform upon a phase of blind absolutism; and in Russia there has never
been anything else to which the faintest tradition could, after ages
of error, go back as to a parting of ways.</p>
<p>In Europe the old monarchical principle stands justified in its historical
struggle with the growth of political liberty by the evolution of the
idea of nationality as we see it concreted at the present time; by the
inception of that wider solidarity grouping together around the standard
of monarchical power these larger, agglomerations of mankind.&nbsp;
This service of unification, creating close-knit communities possessing
the ability, the will, and the power to pursue a common ideal, has prepared
the ground for the advent of a still larger understanding: for the solidarity
of Europeanism, which must be the next step towards the advent of Concord
and Justice; an advent that, however delayed by the fatal worship of
force and the errors of national selfishness, has been, and remains,
the only possible goal of our progress.</p>
<p>The conceptions of legality, of larger patriotism, of national duties
and aspirations have grown under the shadow of the old monarchies of
Europe, which were the creations of historical necessity.&nbsp; There
were seeds of wisdom in their very mistakes and abuses.&nbsp; They had
a past and a future; they were human.&nbsp; But under the shadow of
Russian autocracy nothing could grow.&nbsp; Russian autocracy succeeded
to nothing; it had no historical past, and it cannot hope for a historical
future.&nbsp; It can only end.&nbsp; By no industry of investigation,
by no fantastic stretch of benevolence, can it be presented as a phase
of development through which a Society, a State, must pass on the way
to the full consciousness of its destiny.&nbsp; It lies outside the
stream of progress.&nbsp; This despotism has been utterly un-European.&nbsp;
Neither has it been Asiatic in its nature.&nbsp; Oriental despotisms
belong to the history of mankind; they have left their trace on our
minds and our imagination by their splendour, by their culture, by their
art, by the exploits of great conquerors.&nbsp; The record of their
rise and decay has an intellectual value; they are in their origins
and their course the manifestations of human needs, the instruments
of racial temperament, of catastrophic force, of faith and fanaticism.&nbsp;
The Russian autocracy as we see it now is a thing apart.&nbsp; It is
impossible to assign to it any rational origin in the vices, the misfortunes,
the necessities, or the aspirations of mankind.&nbsp; That despotism
has neither an European nor an Oriental parentage; more, it seems to
have no root either in the institutions or the follies of this earth.&nbsp;
What strikes one with a sort of awe is just this something inhuman in
its character.&nbsp; It is like a visitation, like a curse from Heaven
falling in the darkness of ages upon the immense plains of forest and
steppe lying dumbly on the confines of two continents: a true desert
harbouring no Spirit either of the East or of the West.</p>
<p>This pitiful fate of a country held by an evil spell, suffering from
an awful visitation for which the responsibility cannot be traced either
to her sins or her follies, has made Russia as a nation so difficult
to understand by Europe.&nbsp; From the very first ghastly dawn of her
existence as a State she had to breathe the atmosphere of despotism;
she found nothing but the arbitrary will of an obscure autocrat at the
beginning and end of her organisation.&nbsp; Hence arises her impenetrability
to whatever is true in Western thought.&nbsp; Western thought, when
it crosses her frontier, falls under the spell of her autocracy and
becomes a noxious parody of itself.&nbsp; Hence the contradictions,
the riddles of her national life, which are looked upon with such curiosity
by the rest of the world.&nbsp; The curse had entered her very soul;
autocracy, and nothing else in the world, has moulded her institutions,
and with the poison of slavery drugged the national temperament into
the apathy of a hopeless fatalism.&nbsp; It seems to have gone into
the blood, tainting every mental activity in its source by a half-mystical,
insensate, fascinating assertion of purity and holiness.&nbsp; The Government
of Holy Russia, arrogating to itself the supreme power to torment and
slaughter the bodies of its subjects like a God-sent scourge, has been
most cruel to those whom it allowed to live under the shadow of its
dispensation.&nbsp; The worst crime against humanity of that system
we behold now crouching at bay behind vast heaps of mangled corpses
is the ruthless destruction of innumerable minds.&nbsp; The greatest
horror of the world&mdash;madness&mdash;walked faithfully in its train.&nbsp;
Some of the best intellects of Russia, after struggling in vain against
the spell, ended by throwing themselves at the feet of that hopeless
despotism as a giddy man leaps into an abyss.&nbsp; An attentive survey
of Russia&rsquo;s literature, of her Church, of her administration and
the cross-currents of her thought, must end in the verdict that the
Russia of to-day has not the right to give her voice on a single question
touching the future of humanity, because from the very inception of
her being the brutal destruction of dignity, of truth, of rectitude,
of all that is faithful in human nature has been made the imperative
condition of her existence.&nbsp; The great governmental secret of that
imperium which Prince Bismarck had the insight and the courage to call
<i>Le N&eacute;ant</i>, has been the extirpation of every intellectual
hope.&nbsp; To pronounce in the face of such a past the word Evolution,
which is precisely the expression of the highest intellectual hope,
is a gruesome pleasantry.&nbsp; There can be no evolution out of a grave.&nbsp;
Another word of less scientific sound has been very much pronounced
of late in connection with Russia&rsquo;s future, a word of more vague
import, a word of dread as much as of hope&mdash;Revolution.</p>
<p>In the face of the events of the last four months, this word has
sprung instinctively, as it were, on grave lips, and has been heard
with solemn forebodings.&nbsp; More or less consciously, Europe is preparing
herself for a spectacle of much violence and perhaps of an inspiring
nobility of greatness.&nbsp; And there will be nothing of what she expects.&nbsp;
She will see neither the anticipated character of the violence, nor
yet any signs of generous greatness.&nbsp; Her expectations, more or
less vaguely expressed, give the measure of her ignorance of that <i>N&eacute;ant</i>
which for so many years had remained hidden behind this phantom of invincible
armies.</p>
<p><i>N&eacute;ant</i>!&nbsp; In a way, yes!&nbsp; And yet perhaps Prince
Bismarck has let himself be led away by the seduction of a good phrase
into the use of an inexact form.&nbsp; The form of his judgment had
to be pithy, striking, engraved within a ring.&nbsp; If he erred, then,
no doubt, he erred deliberately.&nbsp; The saying was near enough the
truth to serve, and perhaps he did not want to destroy utterly by a
more severe definition the prestige of the sham that could not deceive
his genius.&nbsp; Prince Bismarck has been really complimentary to the
useful phantom of the autocratic might.&nbsp; There is an awe-inspiring
idea of infinity conveyed in the word <i>N&eacute;ant</i>&mdash;and
in Russia there is no idea.&nbsp; She is not a <i>N&eacute;ant</i>,
she is and has been simply the negation of everything worth living for.&nbsp;
She is not an empty void, she is a yawning chasm open between East and
West; a bottomless abyss that has swallowed up every hope of mercy,
every aspiration towards personal dignity, towards freedom, towards
knowledge, every ennobling desire of the heart, every redeeming whisper
of conscience.&nbsp; Those that have peered into that abyss, where the
dreams of Panslavism, of universal conquest, mingled with the hate and
contempt for Western ideas, drift impotently like shapes of mist, know
well that it is bottomless; that there is in it no ground for anything
that could in the remotest degree serve even the lowest interests of
mankind&mdash;and certainly no ground ready for a revolution.&nbsp;
The sin of the old European monarchies was not the absolutism inherent
in every form of government; it was the inability to alter the forms
of their legality, grown narrow and oppressive with the march of time.&nbsp;
Every form of legality is bound to degenerate into oppression, and the
legality in the forms of monarchical institutions sooner, perhaps, than
any other.&nbsp; It has not been the business of monarchies to be adaptive
from within.&nbsp; With the mission of uniting and consolidating the
particular ambitions and interests of feudalism in favour of a larger
conception of a State, of giving self-consciousness, force and nationality
to the scattered energies of thought and action, they were fated to
lag behind the march of ideas they had themselves set in motion in a
direction they could neither understand nor approve.&nbsp; Yet, for
all that, the thrones still remain, and what is more significant, perhaps,
some of the dynasties, too, have survived.&nbsp; The revolutions of
European States have never been in the nature of absolute protests <i>en
masse</i> against the monarchical principle; they were the uprising
of the people against the oppressive degeneration of legality.&nbsp;
But there never has been any legality in Russia; she is a negation of
that as of everything else that has its root in reason or conscience.&nbsp;
The ground of every revolution had to be intellectually prepared.&nbsp;
A revolution is a short cut in the rational development of national
needs in response to the growth of world-wide ideals.&nbsp; It is conceivably
possible for a monarch of genius to put himself at the head of a revolution
without ceasing to be the king of his people.&nbsp; For the autocracy
of Holy Russia the only conceivable self-reform is&mdash;suicide.</p>
<p>The same relentless fate holds in its grip the all-powerful ruler
and his helpless people.&nbsp; Wielders of a power purchased by an unspeakable
baseness of subjection to the Khans of the Tartar horde, the Princes
of Russia who, in their heart of hearts had come in time to regard themselves
as superior to every monarch of Europe, have never risen to be the chiefs
of a nation.&nbsp; Their authority has never been sanctioned by popular
tradition, by ideas of intelligent loyalty, of devotion, of political
necessity, of simple expediency, or even by the power of the sword.&nbsp;
In whatever form of upheaval autocratic Russia is to find her end, it
can never be a revolution fruitful of moral consequences to mankind.&nbsp;
It cannot be anything else but a rising of slaves.&nbsp; It is a tragic
circumstance that the only thing one can wish to that people who had
never seen face to face either law, order, justice, right, truth about
itself or the rest of the world; who had known nothing outside the capricious
will of its irresponsible masters, is that it should find in the approaching
hour of need, not an organiser or a law-giver, with the wisdom of a
Lycurgus or a Solon for their service, but at least the force of energy
and desperation in some as yet unknown Spartacus.</p>
<p>A brand of hopeless mental and moral inferiority is set upon Russian
achievements; and the coming events of her internal changes, however
appalling they may be in their magnitude, will be nothing more impressive
than the convulsions of a colossal body.&nbsp; As her boasted military
force that, corrupt in its origin, has ever struck no other but faltering
blows, so her soul, kept benumbed by her temporal and spiritual master
with the poison of tyranny and superstition, will find itself on awakening
possessed of no language, a monstrous full-grown child having first
to learn the ways of living thought and articulate speech.&nbsp; It
is safe to say tyranny, assuming a thousand protean shapes, will remain
clinging to her struggles for a long time before her blind multitudes
succeed at last in trampling her out of existence under their millions
of bare feet.</p>
<p>That would be the beginning.&nbsp; What is to come after?&nbsp; The
conquest of freedom to call your soul your own is only the first step
on the road to excellence.&nbsp; We, in Europe, have gone a step or
two further, have had the time to forget how little that freedom means.&nbsp;
To Russia it must seem everything.&nbsp; A prisoner shut up in a noisome
dungeon concentrates all his hope and desire on the moment of stepping
out beyond the gates.&nbsp; It appears to him pregnant with an immense
and final importance; whereas what is important is the spirit in which
he will draw the first breath of freedom, the counsels he will hear,
the hands he may find extended, the endless days of toil that must follow,
wherein he will have to build his future with no other material but
what he can find within himself.</p>
<p>It would be vain for Russia to hope for the support and counsel of
collective wisdom.&nbsp; Since 1870 (as a distinguished statesman of
the old tradition disconsolately exclaimed) &ldquo;il n&rsquo;y a plus
d&rsquo;Europe!&rdquo;&nbsp; There is, indeed, no Europe.&nbsp; The
idea of a Europe united in the solidarity of her dynasties, which for
a moment seemed to dawn on the horizon of the Vienna Congress through
the subsiding dust of Napoleonic alarums and excursions, has been extinguished
by the larger glamour of less restraining ideals.&nbsp; Instead of the
doctrines of solidarity it was the doctrine of nationalities much more
favourable to spoliations that came to the front, and since its greatest
triumphs at Sadowa and Sedan there is no Europe.&nbsp; Meanwhile till
the time comes when there will be no frontiers, there are alliances
so shamelessly based upon the exigencies of suspicion and mistrust that
their cohesive force waxes and wanes with every year, almost with the
event of every passing month.&nbsp; This is the atmosphere Russia will
find when the last rampart of tyranny has been beaten down.&nbsp; But
what hands, what voices will she find on coming out into the light of
day?&nbsp; An ally she has yet who more than any other of Russia&rsquo;s
allies has found that it had parted with lots of solid substance in
exchange for a shadow.&nbsp; It is true that the shadow was indeed the
mightiest, the darkest that the modern world had ever known&mdash;and
the most overbearing.&nbsp; But it is fading now, and the tone of truest
anxiety as to what is to take its place will come, no doubt, from that
and no other direction, and no doubt, also, it will have that note of
generosity which even in the moments of greatest aberration is seldom
wanting in the voice of the French people.</p>
<p>Two neighbours Russia will find at her door.&nbsp; Austria, traditionally
unaggressive whenever her hand is not forced, ruled by a dynasty of
uncertain future, weakened by her duality, can only speak to her in
an uncertain, bilingual phrase.&nbsp; Prussia, grown in something like
forty years from an almost pitiful dependant into a bullying friend
and evil counsellor of Russia&rsquo;s masters, may, indeed, hasten to
extend a strong hand to the weakness of her exhausted body, but if so
it will be only with the intention of tearing away the long-coveted
part of her substance.</p>
<p>Pan-Germanism is by no means a shape of mists, and Germany is anything
but a <i>N&eacute;ant</i> where thought and effort are likely to lose
themselves without sound or trace.&nbsp; It is a powerful and voracious
organisation, full of unscrupulous self-confidence, whose appetite for
aggrandisement will only be limited by the power of helping itself to
the severed members of its friends and neighbours.&nbsp; The era of
wars so eloquently denounced by the old Republicans as the peculiar
blood guilt of dynastic ambitions is by no means over yet.&nbsp; They
will be fought out differently, with lesser frequency, with an increased
bitterness and the savage tooth-and-claw obstinacy of a struggle for
existence.&nbsp; They will make us regret the time of dynastic ambitions,
with their human absurdity moderated by prudence and even by shame,
by the fear of personal responsibility and the regard paid to certain
forms of conventional decency.&nbsp; For, if the monarchs of Europe
have been derided for addressing each other as &ldquo;brother&rdquo;
in autograph communications, that relationship was at least as effective
as any form of brotherhood likely to be established between the rival
nations of this continent, which, we are assured on all hands, is the
heritage of democracy.&nbsp; In the ceremonial brotherhood of monarchs
the reality of blood-ties, for what little it is worth, acted often
as a drag on unscrupulous desires of glory or greed.&nbsp; Besides,
there was always the common danger of exasperated peoples, and some
respect for each other&rsquo;s divine right.&nbsp; No leader of a democracy,
without other ancestry but the sudden shout of a multitude, and debarred
by the very condition of his power from even thinking of a direct heir,
will have any interest in calling brother the leader of another democracy&mdash;a
chief as fatherless and heirless as himself.</p>
<p>The war of 1870, brought about by the third Napoleon&rsquo;s half-generous,
half-selfish adoption of the principle of nationalities, was the first
war characterised by a special intensity of hate, by a new note in the
tune of an old song for which we may thank the Teutonic thoroughness.&nbsp;
Was it not that excellent bourgeoise, Princess Bismarck (to keep only
to great examples), who was so righteously anxious to see men, women
and children&mdash;emphatically the children, too&mdash;of the abominable
French nation massacred off the face of the earth?&nbsp; This illustration
of the new war-temper is artlessly revealed in the prattle of the amiable
Busch, the Chancellor&rsquo;s pet &ldquo;reptile&rdquo; of the Press.&nbsp;
And this was supposed to be a war for an idea!&nbsp; Too much, however,
should not be made of that good wife&rsquo;s and mother&rsquo;s sentiments
any more than of the good First Emperor William&rsquo;s tears, shed
so abundantly after every battle, by letter, telegram, and otherwise,
during the course of the same war, before a dumb and shamefaced continent.&nbsp;
These were merely the expressions of the simplicity of a nation which
more than any other has a tendency to run into the grotesque.&nbsp;
There is worse to come.</p>
<p>To-day, in the fierce grapple of two nations of different race, the
short era of national wars seems about to close.&nbsp; No war will be
waged for an idea.&nbsp; The &ldquo;noxious idle aristocracies&rdquo;
of yesterday fought without malice for an occupation, for the honour,
for the fun of the thing.&nbsp; The virtuous, industrious democratic
States of to-morrow may yet be reduced to fighting for a crust of dry
bread, with all the hate, ferocity, and fury that must attach to the
vital importance of such an issue.&nbsp; The dreams sanguine humanitarians
raised almost to ecstasy about the year fifty of the last century by
the moving sight of the Crystal Palace&mdash;crammed full with that
variegated rubbish which it seems to be the bizarre fate of humanity
to produce for the benefit of a few employers of labour&mdash;have vanished
as quickly as they had arisen.&nbsp; The golden hopes of peace have
in a single night turned to dead leaves in every drawer of every benevolent
theorist&rsquo;s writing table.&nbsp; A swift disenchantment overtook
the incredible infatuation which could put its trust in the peaceful
nature of industrial and commercial competition.</p>
<p>Industrialism and commercialism&mdash;wearing high-sounding names
in many languages (<i>Welt-politik</i> may serve for one instance) picking
up coins behind the severe and disdainful figure of science whose giant
strides have widened for us the horizon of the universe by some few
inches&mdash;stand ready, almost eager, to appeal to the sword as soon
as the globe of the earth has shrunk beneath our growing numbers by
another ell or so.&nbsp; And democracy, which has elected to pin its
faith to the supremacy of material interests, will have to fight their
battles to the bitter end, on a mere pittance&mdash;unless, indeed,
some statesman of exceptional ability and overwhelming prestige succeeds
in carrying through an international understanding for the delimitation
of spheres of trade all over the earth, on the model of the territorial
spheres of influence marked in Africa to keep the competitors for the
privilege of improving the nigger (as a buying machine) from flying
prematurely at each other&rsquo;s throats.</p>
<p>This seems the only expedient at hand for the temporary maintenance
of European peace, with its alliances based on mutual distrust, preparedness
for war as its ideal, and the fear of wounds, luckily stronger, so far,
than the pinch of hunger, its only guarantee.&nbsp; The true peace of
the world will be a place of refuge much less like a beleaguered fortress
and more, let us hope, in the nature of an Inviolable Temple.&nbsp;
It will be built on less perishable foundations than those of material
interests.&nbsp; But it must be confessed that the architectural aspect
of the universal city remains as yet inconceivable&mdash;that the very
ground for its erection has not been cleared of the jungle.</p>
<p>Never before in history has the right of war been more fully admitted
in the rounded periods of public speeches, in books, in public prints,
in all the public works of peace, culminating in the establishment of
the Hague Tribunal&mdash;that solemnly official recognition of the Earth
as a House of Strife.&nbsp; To him whose indignation is qualified by
a measure of hope and affection, the efforts of mankind to work its
own salvation present a sight of alarming comicality.&nbsp; After clinging
for ages to the steps of the heavenly throne, they are now, without
much modifying their attitude, trying with touching ingenuity to steal
one by one the thunderbolts of their Jupiter.&nbsp; They have removed
war from the list of Heaven-sent visitations that could only be prayed
against; they have erased its name from the supplication against the
wrath of war, pestilence, and famine, as it is found in the litanies
of the Roman Catholic Church; they have dragged the scourge down from
the skies and have made it into a calm and regulated institution.&nbsp;
At first sight the change does not seem for the better.&nbsp; Jove&rsquo;s
thunderbolt looks a most dangerous plaything in the hands of the people.&nbsp;
But a solemnly established institution begins to grow old at once in
the discussion, abuse, worship, and execration of men.&nbsp; It grows
obsolete, odious, and intolerable; it stands fatally condemned to an
unhonoured old age.</p>
<p>Therein lies the best hope of advanced thought, and the best way
to help its prospects is to provide in the fullest, frankest way for
the conditions of the present day.&nbsp; War is one of its conditions;
it is its principal condition.&nbsp; It lies at the heart of every question
agitating the fears and hopes of a humanity divided against itself.&nbsp;
The succeeding ages have changed nothing except the watchwords of the
armies.&nbsp; The intellectual stage of mankind being as yet in its
infancy, and States, like most individuals, having but a feeble and
imperfect consciousness of the worth and force of the inner life, the
need of making their existence manifest to themselves is determined
in the direction of physical activity.&nbsp; The idea of ceasing to
grow in territory, in strength, in wealth, in influence&mdash;in anything
but wisdom and self-knowledge&mdash;is odious to them as the omen of
the end.&nbsp; Action, in which is to be found the illusion of a mastered
destiny, can alone satisfy our uneasy vanity and lay to rest the haunting
fear of the future&mdash;a sentiment concealed, indeed, but proving
its existence by the force it has, when invoked, to stir the passions
of a nation.&nbsp; It will be long before we have learned that in the
great darkness before us there is nothing that we need fear.&nbsp; Let
us act lest we perish&mdash;is the cry.&nbsp; And the only form of action
open to a State can be of no other than aggressive nature.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of aggressions, though the sanction of them
is one and the same&mdash;the magazine rifle of the latest pattern.&nbsp;
In preparation for or against that form of action the States of Europe
are spending now such moments of uneasy leisure as they can snatch from
the labours of factory and counting-house.</p>
<p>Never before has war received so much homage at the lips of men,
and reigned with less disputed sway in their minds.&nbsp; It has harnessed
science to its gun-carriages, it has enriched a few respectable manufacturers,
scattered doles of food and raiment amongst a few thousand skilled workmen,
devoured the first youth of whole generations, and reaped its harvest
of countless corpses.&nbsp; It has perverted the intelligence of men,
women, and children, and has made the speeches of Emperors, Kings, Presidents,
and Ministers monotonous with ardent protestations of fidelity to peace.&nbsp;
Indeed, war has made peace altogether its own, it has modelled it on
its own image: a martial, overbearing, war-lord sort of peace, with
a mailed fist, and turned-up moustaches, ringing with the din of grand
manoeuvres, eloquent with allusions to glorious feats of arms; it has
made peace so magnificent as to be almost as expensive to keep up as
itself.&nbsp; It has sent out apostles of its own, who at one time went
about (mostly in newspapers) preaching the gospel of the mystic sanctity
of its sacrifices, and the regenerating power of spilt blood, to the
poor in mind&mdash;whose name is legion.</p>
<p>It has been observed that in the course of earthly greatness a day
of culminating triumph is often paid for by a morrow of sudden extinction.&nbsp;
Let us hope it is so.&nbsp; Yet the dawn of that day of retribution
may be a long time breaking above a dark horizon.&nbsp; War is with
us now; and, whether this one ends soon or late, war will be with us
again.&nbsp; And it is the way of true wisdom for men and States to
take account of things as they are.</p>
<p>Civilisation has done its little best by our sensibilities for whose
growth it is responsible.&nbsp; It has managed to remove the sights
and sounds of battlefields away from our doorsteps.&nbsp; But it cannot
be expected to achieve the feat always and under every variety of circumstance.&nbsp;
Some day it must fail, and we shall have then a wealth of appallingly
unpleasant sensations brought home to us with painful intimacy.&nbsp;
It is not absurd to suppose that whatever war comes to us next it will
<i>not</i> be a distant war waged by Russia either beyond the Amur or
beyond the Oxus.</p>
<p>The Japanese armies have laid that ghost for ever, because the Russia
of the future will not, for the reasons explained above, be the Russia
of to-day.&nbsp; It will not have the same thoughts, resentments and
aims.&nbsp; It is even a question whether it will preserve its gigantic
frame unaltered and unbroken.&nbsp; All speculation loses itself in
the magnitude of the events made possible by the defeat of an autocracy
whose only shadow of a title to existence was the invincible power of
military conquest.&nbsp; That autocratic Russia will have a miserable
end in harmony with its base origin and inglorious life does not seem
open to doubt.&nbsp; The problem of the immediate future is posed not
by the eventual manner but by the approaching fact of its disappearance.</p>
<p>The Japanese armies, in laying the oppressive ghost, have not only
accomplished what will be recognised historically as an important mission
in the world&rsquo;s struggle against all forms of evil, but have also
created a situation.&nbsp; They have created a situation in the East
which they are competent to manage by themselves; and in doing this
they have brought about a change in the condition of the West with which
Europe is not well prepared to deal.&nbsp; The common ground of concord,
good faith and justice is not sufficient to establish an action upon;
since the conscience of but very few men amongst us, and of no single
Western nation as yet, will brook the restraint of abstract ideas as
against the fascination of a material advantage.&nbsp; And eagle-eyed
wisdom alone cannot take the lead of human action, which in its nature
must for ever remain short-sighted.&nbsp; The trouble of the civilised
world is the want of a common conservative principle abstract enough
to give the impulse, practical enough to form the rallying point of
international action tending towards the restraint of particular ambitions.&nbsp;
Peace tribunals instituted for the greater glory of war will not replace
it.&nbsp; Whether such a principle exists&mdash;who can say?&nbsp; If
it does not, then it ought to be invented.&nbsp; A sage with a sense
of humour and a heart of compassion should set about it without loss
of time, and a solemn prophet full of words and fire ought to be given
the task of preparing the minds.&nbsp; So far there is no trace of such
a principle anywhere in sight; even its plausible imitations (never
very effective) have disappeared long ago before the doctrine of national
aspirations.&nbsp; <i>Il n&rsquo;y a plus d&rsquo;Europe</i>&mdash;there
is only an armed and trading continent, the home of slowly maturing
economical contests for life and death and of loudly proclaimed world-wide
ambitions.&nbsp; There are also other ambitions not so loud, but deeply
rooted in the envious acquisitive temperament of the last corner amongst
the great Powers of the Continent, whose feet are not exactly in the
ocean&mdash;not yet&mdash;and whose head is very high up&mdash;in Pomerania,
the breeding place of such precious Grenadiers that Prince Bismarck
(whom it is a pleasure to quote) would not have given the bones of one
of them for the settlement of the old Eastern Question.&nbsp; But times
have changed, since, by way of keeping up, I suppose, some old barbaric
German rite, the faithful servant of the Hohenzollerns was buried alive
to celebrate the accession of a new Emperor.</p>
<p>Already the voice of surmises has been heard hinting tentatively
at a possible re-grouping of European Powers.&nbsp; The alliance of
the three Empires is supposed possible.&nbsp; And it may be possible.&nbsp;
The myth of Russia&rsquo;s power is dying very hard&mdash;hard enough
for that combination to take place&mdash;such is the fascination that
a discredited show of numbers will still exercise upon the imagination
of a people trained to the worship of force.&nbsp; Germany may be willing
to lend its support to a tottering autocracy for the sake of an undisputed
first place, and of a preponderating voice in the settlement of every
question in that south-east of Europe which merges into Asia.&nbsp;
No principle being involved in such an alliance of mere expediency,
it would never be allowed to stand in the way of Germany&rsquo;s other
ambitions.&nbsp; The fall of autocracy would bring its restraint automatically
to an end.&nbsp; Thus it may be believed that the support Russian despotism
may get from its once humble friend and client will not be stamped by
that thoroughness which is supposed to be the mark of German superiority.&nbsp;
Russia weakened down to the second place, or Russia eclipsed altogether
during the throes of her regeneration, will answer equally well the
plans of German policy&mdash;which are many and various and often incredible,
though the aim of them all is the same: aggrandisement of territory
and influence, with no regard to right and justice, either in the East
or in the West.&nbsp; For that and no other is the true note of your
<i>Welt-politik</i> which desires to live.</p>
<p>The German eagle with a Prussian head looks all round the horizon,
not so much for something to do that would count for good in the records
of the earth, as simply for something good to get.&nbsp; He gazes upon
the land and upon the sea with the same covetous steadiness, for he
has become of late a maritime eagle, and has learned to box the compass.&nbsp;
He gazes north and south, and east and west, and is inclined to look
intemperately upon the waters of the Mediterranean when they are blue.&nbsp;
The disappearance of the Russian phantom has given a foreboding of unwonted
freedom to the <i>Welt-politik</i>.&nbsp; According to the national
tendency this assumption of Imperial impulses would run into the grotesque
were it not for the spikes of the <i>pickelhaubes</i> peeping out grimly
from behind.&nbsp; Germany&rsquo;s attitude proves that no peace for
the earth can be found in the expansion of material interests which
she seems to have adopted exclusively as her only aim, ideal, and watchword.&nbsp;
For the use of those who gaze half-unbelieving at the passing away of
the Russian phantom, part Ghoul, part Djinn, part Old Man of the Sea,
and wait half-doubting for the birth of a nation&rsquo;s soul in this
age which knows no miracles, the once-famous saying of poor Gambetta,
tribune of the people (who was simple and believed in the &ldquo;immanent
justice of things&rdquo;), may be adapted in the shape of a warning
that, so far as a future of liberty, concord, and justice is concerned:
&ldquo;Le Prussianisme&mdash;voil&agrave; l&rsquo;ennemi!&rdquo;</p>
<h3>THE CRIME OF PARTITION&mdash;1919</h3>
<p>At the end of the eighteenth century, when the partition of Poland
had become an accomplished fact, the world qualified it at once as a
crime.&nbsp; This strong condemnation proceeded, of course, from the
West of Europe; the Powers of the Centre, Prussia and Austria, were
not likely to admit that this spoliation fell into the category of acts
morally reprehensible and carrying the taint of anti-social guilt.&nbsp;
As to Russia, the third party to the crime, and the originator of the
scheme, she had no national conscience at the time.&nbsp; The will of
its rulers was always accepted by the people as the expression of an
omnipotence derived directly from God.&nbsp; As an act of mere conquest
the best excuse for the partition lay simply in the fact that it happened
to be possible; there was the plunder and there was the opportunity
to get hold of it.&nbsp; Catherine the Great looked upon this extension
of her dominions with a cynical satisfaction.&nbsp; Her political argument
that the destruction of Poland meant the repression of revolutionary
ideas and the checking of the spread of Jacobinism in Europe was a characteristically
impudent pretence.&nbsp; There may have been minds here and there amongst
the Russians that perceived, or perhaps only felt, that by the annexation
of the greater part of the Polish Republic, Russia approached nearer
to the comity of civilised nations and ceased, at least territorially,
to be an Asiatic Power.</p>
<p>It was only after the partition of Poland that Russia began to play
a great part in Europe.&nbsp; To such statesmen as she had then that
act of brigandage must have appeared inspired by great political wisdom.&nbsp;
The King of Prussia, faithful to the ruling principle of his life, wished
simply to aggrandise his dominions at a much smaller cost and at much
less risk than he could have done in any other direction; for at that
time Poland was perfectly defenceless from a material point of view,
and more than ever, perhaps, inclined to put its faith in humanitarian
illusions.&nbsp; Morally, the Republic was in a state of ferment and
consequent weakness, which so often accompanies the period of social
reform.&nbsp; The strength arrayed against her was just then overwhelming;
I mean the comparatively honest (because open) strength of armed forces.&nbsp;
But, probably from innate inclination towards treachery, Frederick of
Prussia selected for himself the part of falsehood and deception.&nbsp;
Appearing on the scene in the character of a friend he entered deliberately
into a treaty of alliance with the Republic, and then, before the ink
was dry, tore it up in brazen defiance of the commonest decency, which
must have been extremely gratifying to his natural tastes.</p>
<p>As to Austria, it shed diplomatic tears over the transaction.&nbsp;
They cannot be called crocodile tears, insomuch that they were in a
measure sincere.&nbsp; They arose from a vivid perception that Austria&rsquo;s
allotted share of the spoil could never compensate her for the accession
of strength and territory to the other two Powers.&nbsp; Austria did
not really want an extension of territory at the cost of Poland.&nbsp;
She could not hope to improve her frontier in that way, and economically
she had no need of Galicia, a province whose natural resources were
undeveloped and whose salt mines did not arouse her cupidity because
she had salt mines of her own.&nbsp; No doubt the democratic complexion
of Polish institutions was very distasteful to the conservative monarchy;
Austrian statesmen did see at the time that the real danger to the principle
of autocracy was in the West, in France, and that all the forces of
Central Europe would be needed for its suppression.&nbsp; But the movement
towards a <i>partage</i> on the part of Russia and Prussia was too definite
to be resisted, and Austria had to follow their lead in the destruction
of a State which she would have preferred to preserve as a possible
ally against Prussian and Russian ambitions.&nbsp; It may be truly said
that the destruction of Poland secured the safety of the French Revolution.&nbsp;
For when in 1795 the crime was consummated, the Revolution had turned
the corner and was in a state to defend itself against the forces of
reaction.</p>
<p>In the second half of the eighteenth century there were two centres
of liberal ideas on the continent of Europe: France and Poland.&nbsp;
On an impartial survey one may say without exaggeration that then France
was relatively every bit as weak as Poland; even, perhaps, more so.&nbsp;
But France&rsquo;s geographical position made her much less vulnerable.&nbsp;
She had no powerful neighbours on her frontier; a decayed Spain in the
south and a conglomeration of small German Principalities on the east
were her happy lot.&nbsp; The only States which dreaded the contamination
of the new principles and had enough power to combat it were Prussia,
Austria, and Russia, and they had another centre of forbidden ideas
to deal with in defenceless Poland, unprotected by nature, and offering
an immediate satisfaction to their cupidity.&nbsp; They made their choice,
and the untold sufferings of a nation which would not die was the price
exacted by fate for the triumph of revolutionary ideals.</p>
<p>Thus even a crime may become a moral agent by the lapse of time and
the course of history.&nbsp; Progress leaves its dead by the way, for
progress is only a great adventure as its leaders and chiefs know very
well in their hearts.&nbsp; It is a march into an undiscovered country;
and in such an enterprise the victims do not count.&nbsp; As an emotional
outlet for the oratory of freedom it was convenient enough to remember
the Crime now and then: the Crime being the murder of a State and the
carving of its body into three pieces.&nbsp; There was really nothing
to do but to drop a few tears and a few flowers of rhetoric upon the
grave.&nbsp; But the spirit of the nation refused to rest therein.&nbsp;
It haunted the territories of the Old Republic in the manner of a ghost
haunting its ancestral mansion where strangers are making themselves
at home; a calumniated, ridiculed, and pooh-pooh&rsquo;d ghost, and
yet never ceasing to inspire a sort of awe, a strange uneasiness, in
the hearts of the unlawful possessors.&nbsp; Poland deprived of its
independence, of its historical continuity, with its religion and language
persecuted and repressed, became a mere geographical expression.&nbsp;
And even that, itself, seemed strangely vague, had lost its definite
character, was rendered doubtful by the theories and the claims of the
spoliators who, by a strange effect of uneasy conscience, while strenuously
denying the moral guilt of the transaction, were always trying to throw
a veil of high rectitude over the Crime.&nbsp; What was most annoying
to their righteousness was the fact that the nation, stabbed to the
heart, refused to grow insensible and cold.&nbsp; That persistent and
almost uncanny vitality was sometimes very inconvenient to the rest
of Europe also.&nbsp; It would intrude its irresistible claim into every
problem of European politics, into the theory of European equilibrium,
into the question of the Near East, the Italian question, the question
of Schleswig-Holstein, and into the doctrine of nationalities.&nbsp;
That ghost, not content with making its ancestral halls uncomfortable
for the thieves, haunted also the Cabinets of Europe, waved indecently
its bloodstained robes in the solemn atmosphere of Council-rooms, where
congresses and conferences sit with closed windows.&nbsp; It would not
be exorcised by the brutal jeers of Bismarck and the fine railleries
of Gorchakov.</p>
<p>As a Polish friend observed to me some years ago: &ldquo;Till the
year &rsquo;48 the Polish problem has been to a certain extent a convenient
rallying-point for all manifestations of liberalism.&nbsp; Since that
time we have come to be regarded simply as a nuisance.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
very disagreeable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I agreed that it was, and he continued: &ldquo;What are we to do?&nbsp;
We did not create the situation by any outside action of ours.&nbsp;
Through all the centuries of its existence Poland has never been a menace
to anybody, not even to the Turks, to whom it has been merely an obstacle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing could be more true.&nbsp; The spirit of aggressiveness was
absolutely foreign to the Polish temperament, to which the preservation
of its institutions and its liberties was much more precious than any
ideas of conquest.&nbsp; Polish wars were defensive, and they were mostly
fought within Poland&rsquo;s own borders.&nbsp; And that those territories
were often invaded was but a misfortune arising from its geographical
position.&nbsp; Territorial expansion was never the master-thought of
Polish statesmen.&nbsp; The consolidation of the territories of the
<i>s&eacute;r&eacute;nissime</i> Republic, which made of it a Power
of the first rank for a time, was not accomplished by force.&nbsp; It
was not the consequence of successful aggression, but of a long and
successful defence against the raiding neighbours from the East.&nbsp;
The lands of Lithuanian and Ruthenian speech were never conquered by
Poland.&nbsp; These peoples were not compelled by a series of exhausting
wars to seek safety in annexation.&nbsp; It was not the will of a prince
or a political intrigue that brought about the union.&nbsp; Neither
was it fear.&nbsp; The slowly-matured view of the economical and social
necessities and, before all, the ripening moral sense of the masses
were the motives that induced the forty three representatives of Lithuanian
and Ruthenian provinces, led by their paramount prince, to enter into
a political combination unique in the history of the world, a spontaneous
and complete union of sovereign States choosing deliberately the way
of peace.&nbsp; Never was strict truth better expressed in a political
instrument than in the preamble of the first Union Treaty (1413).&nbsp;
It begins with the words: &ldquo;This Union, being the outcome not of
hatred, but of love&rdquo;&mdash;words that Poles have not heard addressed
to them politically by any nation for the last hundred and fifty years.</p>
<p>This union being an organic, living thing capable of growth and development
was, later, modified and confirmed by two other treaties, which guaranteed
to all the parties in a just and eternal union all their rights, liberties,
and respective institutions.&nbsp; The Polish State offers a singular
instance of an extremely liberal administrative federalism which, in
its Parliamentary life as well as its international politics, presented
a complete unity of feeling and purpose.&nbsp; As an eminent French
diplomatist remarked many years ago: &ldquo;It is a very remarkable
fact in the history of the Polish State, this invariable and unanimous
consent of the populations; the more so that, the King being looked
upon simply as the chief of the Republic, there was no monarchical bond,
no dynastic fidelity to control and guide the sentiment of the nations,
and their union remained as a pure affirmation of the national will.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The Grand Duchy of Lithuania and its Ruthenian Provinces retained their
statutes, their own administration, and their own political institutions.&nbsp;
That those institutions in the course of time tended to assimilation
with the Polish form was not the result of any pressure, but simply
of the superior character of Polish civilisation.</p>
<p>Even after Poland lost its independence this alliance and this union
remained firm in spirit and fidelity.&nbsp; All the national movements
towards liberation were initiated in the name of the whole mass of people
inhabiting the limits of the old Republic, and all the Provinces took
part in them with complete devotion.&nbsp; It is only in the last generation
that efforts have been made to create a tendency towards separation,
which would indeed serve no one but Poland&rsquo;s common enemies.&nbsp;
And, strangely enough, it is the internationalists, men who professedly
care nothing for race or country, who have set themselves this task
of disruption, one can easily see for what sinister purpose.&nbsp; The
ways of the internationalists may be dark, but they are not inscrutable.</p>
<p>From the same source no doubt there will flow in the future a poisoned
stream of hints of a reconstituted Poland being a danger to the races
once so closely associated within the territories of the Old Republic.&nbsp;
The old partners in &ldquo;the Crime&rdquo; are not likely to forgive
their victim its inconvenient and almost shocking obstinacy in keeping
alive.&nbsp; They had tried moral assassination before and with some
small measure of success, for, indeed, the Polish question, like all
living reproaches, had become a nuisance.&nbsp; Given the wrong, and
the apparent impossibility of righting it without running risks of a
serious nature, some moral alleviation may be found in the belief that
the victim had brought its misfortunes on its own head by its own sins.&nbsp;
That theory, too, had been advanced about Poland (as if other nations
had known nothing of sin and folly), and it made some way in the world
at different times, simply because good care was taken by the interested
parties to stop the mouth of the accused.&nbsp; But it has never carried
much conviction to honest minds.&nbsp; Somehow, in defiance of the cynical
point of view as to the Force of Lies and against all the power of falsified
evidence, truth often turns out to be stronger than calumny.&nbsp; With
the course of years, however, another danger sprang up, a danger arising
naturally from the new political alliances dividing Europe into two
armed camps.&nbsp; It was the danger of silence.&nbsp; Almost without
exception the Press of Western Europe in the twentieth century refused
to touch the Polish question in any shape or form whatever.&nbsp; Never
was the fact of Polish vitality more embarrassing to European diplomacy
than on the eve of Poland&rsquo;s resurrection.</p>
<p>When the war broke out there was something gruesomely comic in the
proclamations of emperors and archdukes appealing to that invincible
soul of a nation whose existence or moral worth they had been so arrogantly
denying for more than a century.&nbsp; Perhaps in the whole record of
human transactions there have never been performances so brazen and
so vile as the manifestoes of the German Emperor and the Grand Duke
Nicholas of Russia; and, I imagine, no more bitter insult has been offered
to human heart and intelligence than the way in which those proclamations
were flung into the face of historical truth.&nbsp; It was like a scene
in a cynical and sinister farce, the absurdity of which became in some
sort unfathomable by the reflection that nobody in the world could possibly
be so abjectly stupid as to be deceived for a single moment.&nbsp; At
that time, and for the first two months of the war, I happened to be
in Poland, and I remember perfectly well that, when those precious documents
came out, the confidence in the moral turpitude of mankind they implied
did not even raise a scornful smile on the lips of men whose most sacred
feelings and dignity they outraged.&nbsp; They did not deign to waste
their contempt on them.&nbsp; In fact, the situation was too poignant
and too involved for either hot scorn or a coldly rational discussion.&nbsp;
For the Poles it was like being in a burning house of which all the
issues were locked.&nbsp; There was nothing but sheer anguish under
the strange, as if stony, calmness which in the utter absence of all
hope falls on minds that are not constitutionally prone to despair.&nbsp;
Yet in this time of dismay the irrepressible vitality of the nation
would not accept a neutral attitude.&nbsp; I was told that even if there
were no issue it was absolutely necessary for the Poles to affirm their
national existence.&nbsp; Passivity, which could be regarded as a craven
acceptance of all the material and moral horrors ready to fall upon
the nation, was not to be thought of for a moment.&nbsp; Therefore,
it was explained to me, the Poles <i>must</i> act.&nbsp; Whether this
was a counsel of wisdom or not it is very difficult to say, but there
are crises of the soul which are beyond the reach of wisdom.&nbsp; When
there is apparently no issue visible to the eyes of reason, sentiment
may yet find a way out, either towards salvation or to utter perdition,
no one can tell&mdash;and the sentiment does not even ask the question.&nbsp;
Being there as a stranger in that tense atmosphere, which was yet not
unfamiliar to me, I was not very anxious to parade my wisdom, especially
after it had been pointed out in answer to my cautious arguments that,
if life has its values worth fighting for, death, too, has that in it
which can make it worthy or unworthy.</p>
<p>Out of the mental and moral trouble into which the grouping of the
Powers at the beginning of war had thrown the counsels of Poland there
emerged at last the decision that the Polish Legions, a peace organisation
in Galicia directed by Pilsudski (afterwards given the rank of General,
and now apparently the Chief of the Government in Warsaw), should take
the field against the Russians.&nbsp; In reality it did not matter against
which partner in the &ldquo;Crime&rdquo; Polish resentment should be
directed.&nbsp; There was little to choose between the methods of Russian
barbarism, which were both crude and rotten, and the cultivated brutality
tinged with contempt of Germany&rsquo;s superficial, grinding civilisation.&nbsp;
There was nothing to choose between them.&nbsp; Both were hateful, and
the direction of the Polish effort was naturally governed by Austria&rsquo;s
tolerant attitude, which had connived for years at the semi-secret organisation
of the Polish Legions.&nbsp; Besides, the material possibility pointed
out the way.&nbsp; That Poland should have turned at first against the
ally of Western Powers, to whose moral support she had been looking
for so many years, is not a greater monstrosity than that alliance with
Russia which had been entered into by England and France with rather
less excuse and with a view to eventualities which could perhaps have
been avoided by a firmer policy and by a greater resolution in the face
of what plainly appeared unavoidable.</p>
<p>For let the truth be spoken.&nbsp; The action of Germany, however
cruel, sanguinary, and faithless, was nothing in the nature of a stab
in the dark.&nbsp; The Germanic Tribes had told the whole world in all
possible tones carrying conviction, the gently persuasive, the coldly
logical; in tones Hegelian, Nietzschean, warlike, pious, cynical, inspired,
what they were going to do to the inferior races of the earth, so full
of sin and all unworthiness.&nbsp; But with a strange similarity to
the prophets of old (who were also great moralists and invokers of might)
they seemed to be crying in a desert.&nbsp; Whatever might have been
the secret searching of hearts, the Worthless Ones would not take heed.&nbsp;
It must also be admitted that the conduct of the menaced Governments
carried with it no suggestion of resistance.&nbsp; It was no doubt,
the effect of neither courage nor fear, but of that prudence which causes
the average man to stand very still in the presence of a savage dog.&nbsp;
It was not a very politic attitude, and the more reprehensible in so
far that it seemed to arise from the mistrust of their own people&rsquo;s
fortitude.&nbsp; On simple matters of life and death a people is always
better than its leaders, because a people cannot argue itself as a whole
into a sophisticated state of mind out of deference for a mere doctrine
or from an exaggerated sense of its own cleverness.&nbsp; I am speaking
now of democracies whose chiefs resemble the tyrant of Syracuse in this,
that their power is unlimited (for who can limit the will of a voting
people?) and who always see the domestic sword hanging by a hair above
their heads.</p>
<p>Perhaps a different attitude would have checked German self-confidence,
and her overgrown militarism would have died from the excess of its
own strength.&nbsp; What would have been then the moral state of Europe
it is difficult to say.&nbsp; Some other excess would probably have
taken its place, excess of theory, or excess of sentiment, or an excess
of the sense of security leading to some other form of catastrophe;
but it is certain that in that case the Polish question would not have
taken a concrete form for ages.&nbsp; Perhaps it would never have taken
form!&nbsp; In this world, where everything is transient, even the most
reproachful ghosts end by vanishing out of old mansions, out of men&rsquo;s
consciences.&nbsp; Progress of enlightenment, or decay of faith?&nbsp;
In the years before the war the Polish ghost was becoming so thin that
it was impossible to get for it the slightest mention in the papers.&nbsp;
A young Pole coming to me from Paris was extremely indignant, but I,
indulging in that detachment which is the product of greater age, longer
experience, and a habit of meditation, refused to share that sentiment.&nbsp;
He had gone begging for a word on Poland to many influential people,
and they had one and all told him that they were going to do no such
thing.&nbsp; They were all men of ideas and therefore might have been
called idealists, but the notion most strongly anchored in their minds
was the folly of touching a question which certainly had no merit of
actuality and would have had the appalling effect of provoking the wrath
of their old enemies and at the same time offending the sensibilities
of their new friends.&nbsp; It was an unanswerable argument.&nbsp; I
couldn&rsquo;t share my young friend&rsquo;s surprise and indignation.&nbsp;
My practice of reflection had also convinced me that there is nothing
on earth that turns quicker on its pivot than political idealism when
touched by the breath of practical politics.</p>
<p>It would be good to remember that Polish independence as embodied
in a Polish State is not the gift of any kind of journalism, neither
is it the outcome even of some particularly benevolent idea or of any
clearly apprehended sense of guilt.&nbsp; I am speaking of what I know
when I say that the original and only formative idea in Europe was the
idea of delivering the fate of Poland into the hands of Russian Tsarism.&nbsp;
And, let us remember, it was assumed then to be a victorious Tsarism
at that.&nbsp; It was an idea talked of openly, entertained seriously,
presented as a benevolence, with a curious blindness to its grotesque
and ghastly character.&nbsp; It was the idea of delivering the victim
with a kindly smile and the confident assurance that &ldquo;it would
be all right&rdquo; to a perfectly unrepentant assassin, who, after
sawing furiously at its throat for a hundred years or so, was expected
to make friends suddenly and kiss it on both cheeks in the mystic Russian
fashion.&nbsp; It was a singularly nightmarish combination of international
polity, and no whisper of any other would have been officially tolerated.&nbsp;
Indeed, I do not think in the whole extent of Western Europe there was
anybody who had the slightest mind to whisper on that subject.&nbsp;
Those were the days of the dark future, when Benckendorf put down his
name on the Committee for the Relief of Polish Populations driven by
the Russian armies into the heart of Russia, when the Grand Duke Nicholas
(the gentleman who advocated a St. Bartholomew&rsquo;s Night for the
suppression of Russian liberalism) was displaying his &ldquo;divine&rdquo;
(I have read the very word in an English newspaper of standing) strategy
in the great retreat, where Mr. Iswolsky carried himself haughtily on
the banks of the Seine; and it was beginning to dawn upon certain people
there that he was a greater nuisance even than the Polish question.</p>
<p>But there is no use in talking about all that.&nbsp; Some clever
person has said that it is always the unexpected that happens, and on
a calm and dispassionate survey the world does appear mainly to one
as a scene of miracles.&nbsp; Out of Germany&rsquo;s strength, in whose
purpose so many people refused to believe, came Poland&rsquo;s opportunity,
in which nobody could have been expected to believe.&nbsp; Out of Russia&rsquo;s
collapse emerged that forbidden thing, the Polish independence, not
as a vengeful figure, the retributive shadow of the crime, but as something
much more solid and more difficult to get rid of&mdash;a political necessity
and a moral solution.&nbsp; Directly it appeared its practical usefulness
became undeniable, and also the fact that, for better or worse, it was
impossible to get rid of it again except by the unthinkable way of another
carving, of another partition, of another crime.</p>
<p>Therein lie the strength and the future of the thing so strictly
forbidden no farther back than two years or so, of the Polish independence
expressed in a Polish State.&nbsp; It comes into the world morally free,
not in virtue of its sufferings, but in virtue of its miraculous rebirth
and of its ancient claim for services rendered to Europe.&nbsp; Not
a single one of the combatants of all the fronts of the world has died
consciously for Poland&rsquo;s freedom.&nbsp; That supreme opportunity
was denied even to Poland&rsquo;s own children.&nbsp; And it is just
as well!&nbsp; Providence in its inscrutable way had been merciful,
for had it been otherwise the load of gratitude would have been too
great, the sense of obligation too crushing, the joy of deliverance
too fearful for mortals, common sinners with the rest of mankind before
the eye of the Most High.&nbsp; Those who died East and West, leaving
so much anguish and so much pride behind them, died neither for the
creation of States, nor for empty words, nor yet for the salvation of
general ideas.&nbsp; They died neither for democracy, nor leagues, nor
systems, nor yet for abstract justice, which is an unfathomable mystery.&nbsp;
They died for something too deep for words, too mighty for the common
standards by which reason measures the advantages of life and death,
too sacred for the vain discourses that come and go on the lips of dreamers,
fanatics, humanitarians, and statesmen.&nbsp; They died . . . .</p>
<p>Poland&rsquo;s independence springs up from that great immolation,
but Poland&rsquo;s loyalty to Europe will not be rooted in anything
so trenchant and burdensome as the sense of an immeasurable indebtedness,
of that gratitude which in a worldly sense is sometimes called eternal,
but which lies always at the mercy of weariness and is fatally condemned
by the instability of human sentiments to end in negation.&nbsp; Polish
loyalty will be rooted in something much more solid and enduring, in
something that could never be called eternal, but which is, in fact,
life-enduring.&nbsp; It will be rooted in the national temperament,
which is about the only thing on earth that can be trusted.&nbsp; Men
may deteriorate, they may improve too, but they don&rsquo;t change.&nbsp;
Misfortune is a hard school which may either mature or spoil a national
character, but it may be reasonably advanced that the long course of
adversity of the most cruel kind has not injured the fundamental characteristics
of the Polish nation which has proved its vitality against the most
demoralising odds.&nbsp; The various phases of the Polish sense of self-preservation
struggling amongst the menacing forces and the no less threatening chaos
of the neighbouring Powers should be judged impartially.&nbsp; I suggest
impartiality and not indulgence simply because, when appraising the
Polish question, it is not necessary to invoke the softer emotions.&nbsp;
A little calm reflection on the past and the present is all that is
necessary on the part of the Western world to judge the movements of
a community whose ideals are the same, but whose situation is unique.&nbsp;
This situation was brought vividly home to me in the course of an argument
more than eighteen months ago.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget,&rdquo;
I was told, &ldquo;that Poland has got to live in contact with Germany
and Russia to the end of time.&nbsp; Do you understand the force of
that expression: &lsquo;To the end of time&rsquo;?&nbsp; Facts must
be taken into account, and especially appalling facts, such as this,
to which there is no possible remedy on earth.&nbsp; For reasons which
are, properly speaking, physiological, a prospect of friendship with
Germans or Russians even in the most distant future is unthinkable.&nbsp;
Any alliance of heart and mind would be a monstrous thing, and monsters,
as we all know, cannot live.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t base your conduct
on a monstrous conception.&nbsp; We are either worth or not worth preserving,
but the horrible psychology of the situation is enough to drive the
national mind to distraction.&nbsp; Yet under a destructive pressure,
of which Western Europe can have no notion, applied by forces that were
not only crushing but corrupting, we have preserved our sanity.&nbsp;
Therefore there can be no fear of our losing our minds simply because
the pressure is removed.&nbsp; We have neither lost our heads nor yet
our moral sense.&nbsp; Oppression, not merely political, but affecting
social relations, family life, the deepest affections of human nature,
and the very fount of natural emotions, has never made us vengeful.&nbsp;
It is worthy of notice that with every incentive present in our emotional
reactions we had no recourse to political assassination.&nbsp; Arms
in hand, hopeless or hopefully, and always against immeasurable odds,
we did affirm ourselves and the justice of our cause; but wild justice
has never been a part of our conception of national manliness.&nbsp;
In all the history of Polish oppression there was only one shot fired
which was not in battle.&nbsp; Only one!&nbsp; And the man who fired
it in Paris at the Emperor Alexander II. was but an individual connected
with no organisation, representing no shade of Polish opinion.&nbsp;
The only effect in Poland was that of profound regret, not at the failure,
but at the mere fact of the attempt.&nbsp; The history of our captivity
is free from that stain; and whatever follies in the eyes of the world
we may have perpetrated, we have neither murdered our enemies nor acted
treacherously against them, nor yet have been reduced to the point of
cursing each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could not gainsay the truth of that discourse, I saw as clearly
as my interlocutor the impossibility of the faintest sympathetic bond
between Poland and her neighbours ever being formed in the future.&nbsp;
The only course that remains to a reconstituted Poland is the elaboration,
establishment, and preservation of the most correct method of political
relations with neighbours to whom Poland&rsquo;s existence is bound
to be a humiliation and an offence.&nbsp; Calmly considered it is an
appalling task, yet one may put one&rsquo;s trust in that national temperament
which is so completely free from aggressiveness and revenge.&nbsp; Therein
lie the foundations of all hope.&nbsp; The success of renewed life for
that nation whose fate is to remain in exile, ever isolated from the
West, amongst hostile surroundings, depends on the sympathetic understanding
of its problems by its distant friends, the Western Powers, which in
their democratic development must recognise the moral and intellectual
kinship of that distant outpost of their own type of civilisation, which
was the only basis of Polish culture.</p>
<p>Whatever may be the future of Russia and the final organisation of
Germany, the old hostility must remain unappeased, the fundamental antagonism
must endure for years to come.&nbsp; The Crime of the Partition was
committed by autocratic Governments which were the Governments of their
time; but those Governments were characterised in the past, as they
will be in the future, by their people&rsquo;s national traits, which
remain utterly incompatible with the Polish mentality and Polish sentiment.&nbsp;
Both the German submissiveness (idealistic as it may be) and the Russian
lawlessness (fed on the corruption of all the virtues) are utterly foreign
to the Polish nation, whose qualities and defects are altogether of
another kind, tending to a certain exaggeration of individualism and,
perhaps, to an extreme belief in the Governing Power of Free Assent:
the one invariably vital principle in the internal government of the
Old Republic.&nbsp; There was never a history more free from political
bloodshed than the history of the Polish State, which never knew either
feudal institutions or feudal quarrels.&nbsp; At the time when heads
were falling on the scaffolds all over Europe there was only one political
execution in Poland&mdash;only one; and as to that there still exists
a tradition that the great Chancellor who democratised Polish institutions,
and had to order it in pursuance of his political purpose, could not
settle that matter with his conscience till the day of his death.&nbsp;
Poland, too, had her civil wars, but this can hardly be made a matter
of reproach to her by the rest of the world.&nbsp; Conducted with humanity,
they left behind them no animosities and no sense of repression, and
certainly no legacy of hatred.&nbsp; They were but a recognised argument
in political discussion and tended always towards conciliation.</p>
<p>I cannot imagine, whatever form of democratic government Poland elaborates
for itself, that either the nation or its leaders would do anything
but welcome the closest scrutiny of their renewed political existence.&nbsp;
The difficulty of the problem of that existence will be so great that
some errors will be unavoidable, and one may be sure that they will
be taken advantage of by its neighbours to discredit that living witness
to a great historical crime.&nbsp; If not the actual frontiers, then
the moral integrity of the new State is sure to be assailed before the
eyes of Europe.&nbsp; Economical enmity will also come into play when
the world&rsquo;s work is resumed again and competition asserts its
power.&nbsp; Charges of aggression are certain to be made, especially
as related to the small States formed of the territories of the Old
Republic.&nbsp; And everybody knows the power of lies which go about
clothed in coats of many colours, whereas, as is well known, Truth has
no such advantage, and for that reason is often suppressed as not altogether
proper for everyday purposes.&nbsp; It is not often recognised, because
it is not always fit to be seen.</p>
<p>Already there are innuendoes, threats, hints thrown out, and even
awful instances fabricated out of inadequate materials, but it is historically
unthinkable that the Poland of the future, with its sacred tradition
of freedom and its hereditary sense of respect for the rights of individuals
and States, should seek its prosperity in aggressive action or in moral
violence against that part of its once fellow-citizens who are Ruthenians
or Lithuanians.&nbsp; The only influence that cannot be restrained is
simply the influence of time, which disengages truth from all facts
with a merciless logic and prevails over the passing opinions, the changing
impulses of men.&nbsp; There can be no doubt that the moral impulses
and the material interests of the new nationalities, which seem to play
now the game of disintegration for the benefit of the world&rsquo;s
enemies, will in the end bring them nearer to the Poland of this war&rsquo;s
creation, will unite them sooner or later by a spontaneous movement
towards the State which had adopted and brought them up in the development
of its own humane culture&mdash;the offspring of the West.</p>
<h3>A NOTE ON THE POLISH PROBLEM&mdash;1916</h3>
<p>We must start from the assumption that promises made by proclamation
at the beginning of this war may be binding on the individuals who made
them under the stress of coming events, but cannot be regarded as binding
the Governments after the end of the war.</p>
<p>Poland has been presented with three proclamations.&nbsp; Two of
them were in such contrast with the avowed principles and the historic
action for the last hundred years (since the Congress of Vienna) of
the Powers concerned, that they were more like cynical insults to the
nation&rsquo;s deepest feelings, its memory and its intelligence, than
state papers of a conciliatory nature.</p>
<p>The German promises awoke nothing but indignant contempt; the Russian
a bitter incredulity of the most complete kind.&nbsp; The Austrian proclamation,
which made no promises and contented itself with pointing out the Austro-Polish
relations for the last forty-five years, was received in silence.&nbsp;
For it is a fact that in Austrian Poland alone Polish nationality was
recognised as an element of the Empire, and individuals could breathe
the air of freedom, of civil life, if not of political independence.</p>
<p>But for Poles to be Germanophile is unthinkable.&nbsp; To be Russophile
or Austrophile is at best a counsel of despair in view of a European
situation which, because of the grouping of the powers, seems to shut
from them every hope, expressed or unexpressed, of a national future
nursed through more than a hundred years of suffering and oppression.</p>
<p>Through most of these years, and especially since 1830, Poland (I
use this expression since Poland exists as a spiritual entity to-day
as definitely as it ever existed in her past) has put her faith in the
Western Powers.&nbsp; Politically it may have been nothing more than
a consoling illusion, and the nation had a half-consciousness of this.&nbsp;
But what Poland was looking for from the Western Powers without discouragement
and with unbroken confidence was moral support.</p>
<p>This is a fact of the sentimental order.&nbsp; But such facts have
their positive value, for their idealism derives from perhaps the highest
kind of reality.&nbsp; A sentiment asserts its claim by its force, persistence
and universality.&nbsp; In Poland that sentimental attitude towards
the Western Powers is universal.&nbsp; It extends to all classes.&nbsp;
The very children are affected by it as soon as they begin to think.</p>
<p>The political value of such a sentiment consists in this, that it
is based on profound resemblances.&nbsp; Therefore one can build on
it as if it were a material fact.&nbsp; For the same reason it would
be unsafe to disregard it if one proposed to build solidly.&nbsp; The
Poles, whom superficial or ill-informed theorists are trying to force
into the social and psychological formula of Slavonism, are in truth
not Slavonic at all.&nbsp; In temperament, in feeling, in mind, and
even in unreason, they are Western, with an absolute comprehension of
all Western modes of thought, even of those which are remote from their
historical experience.</p>
<p>That element of racial unity which may be called Polonism, remained
compressed between Prussian Germanism on one side and the Russian Slavonism
on the other.&nbsp; For Germanism it feels nothing but hatred.&nbsp;
But between Polonism and Slavonism there is not so much hatred as a
complete and ineradicable incompatibility.</p>
<p>No political work of reconstructing Poland either as a matter of
justice or expediency could be sound which would leave the new creation
in dependence to Germanism or to Slavonism.</p>
<p>The first need not be considered.&nbsp; The second must be&mdash;unless
the Powers elect to drop the Polish question either under the cover
of vague assurances or without any disguise whatever.</p>
<p>But if it is considered it will be seen at once that the Slavonic
solution of the Polish Question can offer no guarantees of duration
or hold the promise of security for the peace of Europe.</p>
<p>The only basis for it would be the Grand Duke&rsquo;s Manifesto.&nbsp;
But that Manifesto, signed by a personage now removed from Europe to
Asia, and by a man, moreover, who if true to himself, to his conception
of patriotism and to his family tradition could not have put his hand
to it with any sincerity of purpose, is now divested of all authority.&nbsp;
The forcible vagueness of its promises, its startling inconsistency
with the hundred years of ruthlessly denationalising oppression permit
one to doubt whether it was ever meant to have any authority.</p>
<p>But in any case it could have had no effect.&nbsp; The very nature
of things would have brought to nought its professed intentions.</p>
<p>It is impossible to suppose that a State of Russia&rsquo;s power
and antecedents would tolerate a privileged community (of, to Russia,
unnational complexion) within the body of the Empire.&nbsp; All history
shows that such an arrangement, however hedged in by the most solemn
treaties and declarations, cannot last.&nbsp; In this case it would
lead to a tragic issue.&nbsp; The absorption of Polonism is unthinkable.&nbsp;
The last hundred years of European History proves it undeniably.&nbsp;
There remains then extirpation, a process of blood and iron; and the
last act of the Polish drama would be played then before a Europe too
weary to interfere, and to the applause of Germany.</p>
<p>It would not be just to say that the disappearance of Polonism would
add any strength to the Slavonic power of expansion.&nbsp; It would
add no strength, but it would remove a possibly effective barrier against
the surprises the future of Europe may hold in store for the Western
Powers.</p>
<p>Thus the question whether Polonism is worth saving presents itself
as a problem of politics with a practical bearing on the stability of
European peace&mdash;as a barrier or perhaps better (in view of its
detached position) as an outpost of the Western Powers placed between
the great might of Slavonism which has not yet made up its mind to anything,
and the organised Germanism which has spoken its mind with no uncertain
voice, before the world.</p>
<p>Looked at in that light alone Polonism seems worth saving.&nbsp;
That it has lived so long on its trust in the moral support of the Western
Powers may give it another and even stronger claim, based on a truth
of a more profound kind.&nbsp; Polonism had resisted the utmost efforts
of Germanism and Slavonism for more than a hundred years.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp;
Because of the strength of its ideals conscious of their kinship with
the West.&nbsp; Such a power of resistance creates a moral obligation
which it would be unsafe to neglect.&nbsp; There is always a risk in
throwing away a tool of proved temper.</p>
<p>In this profound conviction of the practical and ideal worth of Polonism
one approaches the problem of its preservation with a very vivid sense
of the practical difficulties derived from the grouping of the Powers.&nbsp;
The uncertainty of the extent and of the actual form of victory for
the Allies will increase the difficulty of formulating a plan of Polish
regeneration at the present moment.</p>
<p>Poland, to strike its roots again into the soil of political Europe,
will require a guarantee of security for the healthy development and
for the untrammelled play of such institutions as she may be enabled
to give to herself.</p>
<p>Those institutions will be animated by the spirit of Polonism, which,
having been a factor in the history of Europe and having proved its
vitality under oppression, has established its right to live.&nbsp;
That spirit, despised and hated by Germany and incompatible with Slavonism
because of moral differences, cannot avoid being (in its renewed assertion)
an object of dislike and mistrust.</p>
<p>As an unavoidable consequence of the past Poland will have to begin
its existence in an atmosphere of enmities and suspicions.&nbsp; That
advanced outpost of Western civilisation will have to hold its ground
in the midst of hostile camps: always its historical fate.</p>
<p>Against the menace of such a specially dangerous situation the paper
and ink of public Treaties cannot be an effective defence.&nbsp; Nothing
but the actual, living, active participation of the two Western Powers
in the establishment of the new Polish commonwealth, and in the first
twenty years of its existence, will give the Poles a sufficient guarantee
of security in the work of restoring their national life.</p>
<p>An Anglo-French protectorate would be the ideal form of moral and
material support.&nbsp; But Russia, as an ally, must take her place
in it on such a footing as will allay to the fullest extent her possible
apprehensions and satisfy her national sentiment.&nbsp; That necessity
will have to be formally recognised.</p>
<p>In reality Russia has ceased to care much for her Polish possessions.&nbsp;
Public recognition of a mistake in political morality and a voluntary
surrender of territory in the cause of European concord, cannot damage
the prestige of a powerful State.&nbsp; The new spheres of expansion
in regions more easily assimilable, will more than compensate Russia
for the loss of territory on the Western frontier of the Empire.</p>
<p>The experience of Dual Controls and similar combinations has been
so unfortunate in the past that the suggestion of a Triple Protectorate
may well appear at first sight monstrous even to unprejudiced minds.&nbsp;
But it must be remembered that this is a unique case and a problem altogether
exceptional, justifying the employment of exceptional means for its
solution.&nbsp; To those who would doubt the possibility of even bringing
such a scheme into existence the answer may be made that there are psychological
moments when any measure tending towards the ends of concord and justice
may be brought into being.&nbsp; And it seems that the end of the war
would be the moment for bringing into being the political scheme advocated
in this note.</p>
<p>Its success must depend on the singleness of purpose in the contracting
Powers, and on the wisdom, the tact, the abilities, the good-will of
men entrusted with its initiation and its further control.&nbsp; Finally
it may be pointed out that this plan is the only one offering serious
guarantees to all the parties occupying their respective positions within
the scheme.</p>
<p>If her existence as a state is admitted as just, expedient and necessary,
Poland has the moral right to receive her constitution not from the
hand of an old enemy, but from the Western Powers alone, though of course
with the fullest concurrence of Russia.</p>
<p>This constitution, elaborated by a committee of Poles nominated by
the three Governments, will (after due discussion and amendment by the
High Commissioners of the Protecting Powers) be presented to Poland
as the initial document, the charter of her new life, freely offered
and unreservedly accepted.</p>
<p>It should be as simple and short as a written constitution can be&mdash;establishing
the Polish Commonwealth, settling the lines of representative institutions,
the form of judicature, and leaving the greatest measure possible of
self-government to the provinces forming part of the re-created Poland.</p>
<p>This constitution will be promulgated immediately after the three
Powers had settled the frontiers of the new State, including the town
of Danzic (free port) and a proportion of seaboard.&nbsp; The legislature
will then be called together and a general treaty will regulate Poland&rsquo;s
international portion as a protected state, the status of the High Commissioners
and such-like matters.&nbsp; The legislature will ratify, thus making
Poland, as it were, a party in the establishment of the protectorate.&nbsp;
A point of importance.</p>
<p>Other general treaties will define Poland&rsquo;s position in the
Anglo-Franco-Russian alliance, fix the numbers of the army, and settle
the participation of the Powers in its organisation and training.</p>
<h3>POLAND REVISITED&mdash;1915</h3>
<h4>I.</h4>
<p>I have never believed in political assassination as a means to an
end, and least of all in assassination of the dynastic order.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t know how far murder can ever approach the perfection of
a fine art, but looked upon with the cold eye of reason it seems but
a crude expedient of impatient hope or hurried despair.&nbsp; There
are few men whose premature death could influence human affairs more
than on the surface.&nbsp; The deeper stream of causes depends not on
individuals who, like the mass of mankind, are carried on by a destiny
which no murder has ever been able to placate, divert, or arrest.</p>
<p>In July of last year I was a stranger in a strange city in the Midlands
and particularly out of touch with the world&rsquo;s politics.&nbsp;
Never a very diligent reader of newspapers, there were at that time
reasons of a private order which caused me to be even less informed
than usual on public affairs as presented from day to day in that necessarily
atmosphereless, perspectiveless manner of the daily papers, which somehow,
for a man possessed of some historic sense, robs them of all real interest.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t think I had looked at a daily for a month past.</p>
<p>But though a stranger in a strange city I was not lonely, thanks
to a friend who had travelled there out of pure kindness to bear me
company in a conjuncture which, in a most private sense, was somewhat
trying.</p>
<p>It was this friend who, one morning at breakfast, informed me of
the murder of the Archduke Ferdinand.</p>
<p>The impression was mediocre.&nbsp; I was barely aware that such a
man existed.&nbsp; I remembered only that not long before he had visited
London.&nbsp; The recollection was rather of a cloud of insignificant
printed words his presence in this country provoked.</p>
<p>Various opinions had been expressed of him, but his importance was
Archducal, dynastic, purely accidental.&nbsp; Can there be in the world
of real men anything more shadowy than an Archduke?&nbsp; And now he
was no more; removed with an atrocity of circumstances which made one
more sensible of his humanity than when he was in life.&nbsp; I connected
that crime with Balkanic plots and aspirations so little that I had
actually to ask where it had happened.&nbsp; My friend told me it was
in Serajevo, and wondered what would be the consequences of that grave
event.&nbsp; He asked me what I thought would happen next.</p>
<p>It was with perfect sincerity that I answered &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo;
and having a great repugnance to consider murder as a factor of politics,
I dismissed the subject.&nbsp; It fitted with my ethical sense that
an act cruel and absurd should be also useless.&nbsp; I had also the
vision of a crowd of shadowy Archdukes in the background, out of which
one would step forward to take the place of that dead man in the light
of the European stage.&nbsp; And then, to speak the whole truth, there
was no man capable of forming a judgment who attended so little to the
march of events as I did at that time.&nbsp; What for want of a more
definite term I must call my mind was fixed upon my own affairs, not
because they were in a bad posture, but because of their fascinating
holiday-promising aspect.&nbsp; I had been obtaining my information
as to Europe at second hand, from friends good enough to come down now
and then to see us.&nbsp; They arrived with their pockets full of crumpled
newspapers, and answered my queries casually, with gentle smiles of
scepticism as to the reality of my interest.&nbsp; And yet I was not
indifferent; but the tension in the Balkans had become chronic after
the acute crisis, and one could not help being less conscious of it.&nbsp;
It had wearied out one&rsquo;s attention.&nbsp; Who could have guessed
that on that wild stage we had just been looking at a miniature rehearsal
of the great world-drama, the reduced model of the very passions and
violences of what the future held in store for the Powers of the Old
World?&nbsp; Here and there, perhaps, rare minds had a suspicion of
that possibility, while they watched Old Europe stage-managing fussily
by means of notes and conferences, the prophetic reproduction of its
awaiting fate.&nbsp; It was wonderfully exact in the spirit; same roar
of guns, same protestations of superiority, same words in the air; race,
liberation, justice&mdash;and the same mood of trivial demonstrations.&nbsp;
One could not take to-day a ticket for Petersburg.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
mean Petrograd,&rdquo; would say the booking clerk.&nbsp; Shortly after
the fall of Adrianople a friend of mine passing through Sophia asked
for some <i>caf&eacute; turc</i> at the end of his lunch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur veut dire Caf&eacute; balkanique,&rdquo; the patriotic
waiter corrected him austerely.</p>
<p>I will not say that I had not observed something of that instructive
aspect of the war of the Balkans both in its first and in its second
phase.&nbsp; But those with whom I touched upon that vision were pleased
to see in it the evidence of my alarmist cynicism.&nbsp; As to alarm,
I pointed out that fear is natural to man, and even salutary.&nbsp;
It has done as much as courage for the preservation of races and institutions.&nbsp;
But from a charge of cynicism I have always shrunk instinctively.&nbsp;
It is like a charge of being blind in one eye, a moral disablement,
a sort of disgraceful calamity that must he carried off with a jaunty
bearing&mdash;a sort of thing I am not capable of.&nbsp; Rather than
be thought a mere jaunty cripple I allowed myself to be blinded by the
gross obviousness of the usual arguments.&nbsp; It was pointed out to
me that these Eastern nations were not far removed from a savage state.&nbsp;
Their economics were yet at the stage of scratching the earth and feeding
the pigs.&nbsp; The highly-developed material civilisation of Europe
could not allow itself to be disturbed by a war.&nbsp; The industry
and the finance could not allow themselves to be disorganised by the
ambitions of an idle class, or even the aspirations, whatever they might
be, of the masses.</p>
<p>Very plausible all this sounded.&nbsp; War does not pay.&nbsp; There
had been a book written on that theme&mdash;an attempt to put pacificism
on a material basis.&nbsp; Nothing more solid in the way of argument
could have been advanced on this trading and manufacturing globe.&nbsp;
War was &ldquo;bad business!&rdquo;&nbsp; This was final.</p>
<p>But, truth to say, on this July day I reflected but little on the
condition of the civilised world.&nbsp; Whatever sinister passions were
heaving under its splendid and complex surface, I was too agitated by
a simple and innocent desire of my own, to notice the signs or interpret
them correctly.&nbsp; The most innocent of passions will take the edge
off one&rsquo;s judgment.&nbsp; The desire which possessed me was simply
the desire to travel.&nbsp; And that being so it would have taken something
very plain in the way of symptoms to shake my simple trust in the stability
of things on the Continent.&nbsp; My sentiment and not my reason was
engaged there.&nbsp; My eyes were turned to the past, not to the future;
the past that one cannot suspect and mistrust, the shadowy and unquestionable
moral possession the darkest struggles of which wear a halo of glory
and peace.</p>
<p>In the preceding month of May we had received an invitation to spend
some weeks in Poland in a country house in the neighbourhood of Cracow,
but within the Russian frontier.&nbsp; The enterprise at first seemed
to me considerable.&nbsp; Since leaving the sea, to which I have been
faithful for so many years, I have discovered that there is in my composition
very little stuff from which travellers are made.&nbsp; I confess that
my first impulse about a projected journey is to leave it alone.&nbsp;
But the invitation received at first with a sort of dismay ended by
rousing the dormant energy of my feelings.&nbsp; Cracow is the town
where I spent with my father the last eighteen months of his life.&nbsp;
It was in that old royal and academical city that I ceased to be a child,
became a boy, had known the friendships, the admirations, the thoughts
and the indignations of that age.&nbsp; It was within those historical
walls that I began to understand things, form affections, lay up a store
of memories and a fund of sensations with which I was to break violently
by throwing myself into an unrelated existence.&nbsp; It was like the
experience of another world.&nbsp; The wings of time made a great dusk
over all this, and I feared at first that if I ventured bodily in there
I would discover that I who have had to do with a good many imaginary
lives have been embracing mere shadows in my youth.&nbsp; I feared.&nbsp;
But fear in itself may become a fascination.&nbsp; Men have gone, alone
and trembling, into graveyards at midnight&mdash;just to see what would
happen.&nbsp; And this adventure was to be pursued in sunshine.&nbsp;
Neither would it be pursued alone.&nbsp; The invitation was extended
to us all.&nbsp; This journey would have something of a migratory character,
the invasion of a tribe.&nbsp; My present, all that gave solidity and
value to it, at any rate, would stand by me in this test of the reality
of my past.&nbsp; I was pleased with the idea of showing my companions
what Polish country life was like; to visit the town where I was at
school before the boys by my side should grow too old, and gaining an
individual past of their own, should lose their unsophisticated interest
in mine.&nbsp; It is only in the short instants of early youth that
we have the faculty of coming out of ourselves to see dimly the visions
and share the emotions of another soul.&nbsp; For youth all is reality
in this world, and with justice, since it apprehends so vividly its
images behind which a longer life makes one doubt whether there is any
substance.&nbsp; I trusted to the fresh receptivity of these young beings
in whom, unless Heredity is an empty word, there should have been a
fibre which would answer to the sight, to the atmosphere, to the memories
of that corner of the earth where my own boyhood had received its earliest
independent impressions.</p>
<p>The first days of the third week in July, while the telegraph wires
hummed with the words of enormous import which were to fill blue books,
yellow books, white books, and to arouse the wonder of mankind, passed
for us in light-hearted preparations for the journey.&nbsp; What was
it but just a rush through Germany, to get across as quickly as possible?</p>
<p>Germany is the part of the earth&rsquo;s solid surface of which I
know the least.&nbsp; In all my life I had been across it only twice.&nbsp;
I may well say of it <i>vidi tantum</i>; and the very little I saw was
through the window of a railway carriage at express speed.&nbsp; Those
journeys of mine had been more like pilgrimages when one hurries on
towards the goal for the satisfaction of a deeper need than curiosity.&nbsp;
In this last instance, too, I was so incurious that I would have liked
to have fallen asleep on the shores of England and opened my eyes, if
it were possible, only on the other side of the Silesian frontier.&nbsp;
Yet, in truth, as many others have done, I had &ldquo;sensed it&rdquo;&mdash;that
promised land of steel, of chemical dyes, of method, of efficiency;
that race planted in the middle of Europe, assuming in grotesque vanity
the attitude of Europeans amongst effete Asiatics or barbarous niggers;
and, with a consciousness of superiority freeing their hands from all
moral bonds, anxious to take up, if I may express myself so, the &ldquo;perfect
man&rsquo;s burden.&rdquo;&nbsp; Meantime, in a clearing of the Teutonic
forest, their sages were rearing a Tree of Cynical Wisdom, a sort of
Upas tree, whose shade may be seen now lying over the prostrate body
of Belgium.&nbsp; It must be said that they laboured openly enough,
watering it with the most authentic sources of all madness, and watching
with their be-spectacled eyes the slow ripening of the glorious blood-red
fruit.&nbsp; The sincerest words of peace, words of menace, and I verily
believe words of abasement, even if there had been a voice vile enough
to utter them, would have been wasted on their ecstasy.&nbsp; For when
the fruit ripens on a branch it must fall.&nbsp; There is nothing on
earth that can prevent it.</p>
<h4>II.</h4>
<p>For reasons which at first seemed to me somewhat obscure, that one
of my companions whose wishes are law decided that our travels should
begin in an unusual way by the crossing of the North Sea.&nbsp; We should
proceed from Harwich to Hamburg.&nbsp; Besides being thirty-six times
longer than the Dover-Calais passage this rather unusual route had an
air of adventure in better keeping with the romantic feeling of this
Polish journey which for so many years had been before us in a state
of a project full of colour and promise, but always retreating, elusive
like an enticing mirage.</p>
<p>And, after all, it had turned out to be no mirage.&nbsp; No wonder
they were excited.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no mean experience to lay your hands
on a mirage.&nbsp; The day of departure had come, the very hour had
struck.&nbsp; The luggage was coming downstairs.&nbsp; It was most convincing.&nbsp;
Poland then, if erased from the map, yet existed in reality; it was
not a mere <i>pays du r&ecirc;ve</i>, where you can travel only in imagination.&nbsp;
For no man, they argued, not even father, an habitual pursuer of dreams,
would push the love of the novelist&rsquo;s art of make-believe to the
point of burdening himself with real trunks for a voyage <i>au pays
du r&ecirc;ve</i>.</p>
<p>As we left the door of our house, nestling in, perhaps, the most
peaceful nook in Kent, the sky, after weeks of perfectly brazen serenity,
veiled its blue depths and started to weep fine tears for the refreshment
of the parched fields.&nbsp; A pearly blur settled over them, and a
light sifted of all glare, of everything unkindly and searching that
dwells in the splendour of unveiled skies.&nbsp; All unconscious of
going towards the very scenes of war, I carried off in my eye, this
tiny fragment of Great Britain; a few fields, a wooded rise; a clump
of trees or two, with a short stretch of road, and here and there a
gleam of red wall and tiled roof above the darkening hedges wrapped
up in soft mist and peace.&nbsp; And I felt that all this had a very
strong hold on me as the embodiment of a beneficent and gentle spirit;
that it was dear to me not as an inheritance, but as an acquisition,
as a conquest in the sense in which a woman is conquered&mdash;by love,
which is a sort of surrender.</p>
<p>These were strange, as if disproportionate thoughts to the matter
in hand, which was the simplest sort of a Continental holiday.&nbsp;
And I am certain that my companions, near as they are to me, felt no
other trouble but the suppressed excitement of pleasurable anticipation.&nbsp;
The forms and the spirit of the land before their eyes were their inheritance,
not their conquest&mdash;which is a thing precarious, and, therefore,
the most precious, possessing you if only by the fear of unworthiness
rather than possessed by you.&nbsp; Moreover, as we sat together in
the same railway carriage, they were looking forward to a voyage in
space, whereas I felt more and more plainly, that what I had started
on was a journey in time, into the past; a fearful enough prospect for
the most consistent, but to him who had not known how to preserve against
his impulses the order and continuity of his life&mdash;so that at times
it presented itself to his conscience as a series of betrayals&mdash;still
more dreadful.</p>
<p>I down here these thoughts so exclusively personal, to explain why
there was no room in my consciousness for the apprehension of a European
war.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mean to say that I ignored the possibility;
I simply did not think of it.&nbsp; And it made no difference; for if
I had thought of it, it could only have been in the lame and inconclusive
way of the common uninitiated mortals; and I am sure that nothing short
of intellectual certitude&mdash;obviously unattainable by the man in
the street&mdash;could have stayed me on that journey which now that
I had started on it seemed an irrevocable thing, a necessity of my self-respect.</p>
<p>London, the London before the war, flaunting its enormous glare,
as of a monstrous conflagration up into the black sky&mdash;with its
best Venice-like aspect of rainy evenings, the wet asphalted streets
lying with the sheen of sleeping water in winding canals, and the great
houses of the city towering all dark, like empty palaces, above the
reflected lights of the glistening roadway.</p>
<p>Everything in the subdued incomplete night-life around the Mansion
House went on normally with its fascinating air of a dead commercial
city of sombre walls through which the inextinguishable activity of
its millions streamed East and West in a brilliant flow of lighted vehicles.</p>
<p>In Liverpool Street, as usual too, through the double gates, a continuous
line of taxi-cabs glided down the inclined approach and up again, like
an endless chain of dredger-buckets, pouring in the passengers, and
dipping them out of the great railway station under the inexorable pallid
face of the clock telling off the diminishing minutes of peace.&nbsp;
It was the hour of the boat-trains to Holland, to Hamburg, and there
seemed to be no lack of people, fearless, reckless, or ignorant, who
wanted to go to these places.&nbsp; The station was normally crowded,
and if there was a great flutter of evening papers in the multitude
of hands there were no signs of extraordinary emotion on that multitude
of faces.&nbsp; There was nothing in them to distract me from the thought
that it was singularly appropriate that I should start from this station
on the retraced way of my existence.&nbsp; For this was the station
at which, thirty-seven years before, I arrived on my first visit to
London.&nbsp; Not the same building, but the same spot.&nbsp; At nineteen
years of age, after a period of probation and training I had imposed
upon myself as ordinary seaman on board a North Sea coaster, I had come
up from Lowestoft&mdash;my first long railway journey in England&mdash;to
&ldquo;sign on&rdquo; for an Antipodean voyage in a deep-water ship.&nbsp;
Straight from a railway carriage I had walked into the great city with
something of the feeling of a traveller penetrating into a vast and
unexplored wilderness.&nbsp; No explorer could have been more lonely.&nbsp;
I did not know a single soul of all these millions that all around me
peopled the mysterious distances of the streets.&nbsp; I cannot say
I was free from a little youthful awe, but at that age one&rsquo;s feelings
are simple.&nbsp; I was elated.&nbsp; I was pursuing a clear aim, I
was carrying out a deliberate plan of making out of myself, in the first
place, a seaman worthy of the service, good enough to work by the side
of the men with whom I was to live; and in the second place, I had to
justify my existence to myself, to redeem a tacit moral pledge.&nbsp;
Both these aims were to be attained by the same effort.&nbsp; How simple
seemed the problem of life then, on that hazy day of early September
in the year 1878, when I entered London for the first time.</p>
<p>From that point of view&mdash;Youth and a straightforward scheme
of conduct&mdash;it was certainly a year of grace.&nbsp; All the help
I had to get in touch with the world I was invading was a piece of paper
not much bigger than the palm of my hand&mdash;in which I held it&mdash;torn
out of a larger plan of London for the greater facility of reference.&nbsp;
It had been the object of careful study for some days past.&nbsp; The
fact that I could take a conveyance at the station never occurred to
my mind, no, not even when I got out into the street, and stood, taking
my anxious bearings, in the midst, so to speak, of twenty thousand hansoms.&nbsp;
A strange absence of mind or unconscious conviction that one cannot
approach an important moment of one&rsquo;s life by means of a hired
carriage?&nbsp; Yes, it would have been a preposterous proceeding.&nbsp;
And indeed I was to make an Australian voyage and encircle the globe
before ever entering a London hansom.</p>
<p>Another document, a cutting from a newspaper, containing the address
of an obscure shipping agent, was in my pocket.&nbsp; And I needed not
to take it out.&nbsp; That address was as if graven deep in my brain.&nbsp;
I muttered its words to myself as I walked on, navigating the sea of
London by the chart concealed in the palm of my hand; for I had vowed
to myself not to inquire my way from anyone.&nbsp; Youth is the time
of rash pledges.&nbsp; Had I taken a wrong turning I would have been
lost; and if faithful to my pledge I might have remained lost for days,
for weeks, have left perhaps my bones to be discovered bleaching in
some blind alley of the Whitechapel district, as it had happened to
lonely travellers lost in the bush.&nbsp; But I walked on to my destination
without hesitation or mistake, showing there, for the first time, some
of that faculty to absorb and make my own the imaged topography of a
chart, which in later years was to help me in regions of intricate navigation
to keep the ships entrusted to me off the ground.&nbsp; The place I
was bound to was not easy to find.&nbsp; It was one of those courts
hidden away from the charted and navigable streets, lost among the thick
growth of houses like a dark pool in the depths of a forest, approached
by an inconspicuous archway as if by secret path; a Dickensian nook
of London, that wonder city, the growth of which bears no sign of intelligent
design, but many traces of freakishly sombre phantasy the Great Master
knew so well how to bring out by the magic of his understanding love.&nbsp;
And the office I entered was Dickensian too.&nbsp; The dust of the Waterloo
year lay on the panes and frames of its windows; early Georgian grime
clung to its sombre wainscoting.</p>
<p>It was one o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, but the day was gloomy.&nbsp;
By the light of a single gas-jet depending from the smoked ceiling I
saw an elderly man, in a long coat of black broadcloth.&nbsp; He had
a grey beard, a big nose, thick lips, and heavy shoulders.&nbsp; His
curly white hair and the general character of his head recalled vaguely
a burly apostle in the <i>barocco</i> style of Italian art.&nbsp; Standing
up at a tall, shabby, slanting desk, his silver-rimmed spectacles pushed
up high on his forehead, he was eating a mutton-chop, which had been
just brought to him from some Dickensian eating-house round the corner.</p>
<p>Without ceasing to eat he turned to me his florid, <i>barocco</i>
apostle&rsquo;s face with an expression of inquiry.</p>
<p>I produced elaborately a series of vocal sounds which must have borne
sufficient resemblance to the phonetics of English speech, for his face
broke into a smile of comprehension almost at once.&mdash;&ldquo;Oh,
it&rsquo;s you who wrote a letter to me the other day from Lowestoft
about getting a ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had written to him from Lowestoft.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t remember
a single word of that letter now.&nbsp; It was my very first composition
in the English language.&nbsp; And he had understood it, evidently,
for he spoke to the point at once, explaining that his business, mainly,
was to find good ships for young gentlemen who wanted to go to sea as
premium apprentices with a view of being trained for officers.&nbsp;
But he gathered that this was not my object.&nbsp; I did not desire
to be apprenticed.&nbsp; Was that the case?</p>
<p>It was.&nbsp; He was good enough to say then, &ldquo;Of course I
see that you are a gentleman.&nbsp; But your wish is to get a berth
before the mast as an Able Seaman if possible.&nbsp; Is that it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was certainly my wish; but he stated doubtfully that he feared
he could not help me much in this.&nbsp; There was an Act of Parliament
which made it penal to procure ships for sailors.&nbsp; &ldquo;An Act-of-Parliament.&nbsp;
A law,&rdquo; he took pains to impress it again and again on my foreign
understanding, while I looked at him in consternation.</p>
<p>I had not been half an hour in London before I had run my head against
an Act of Parliament!&nbsp; What a hopeless adventure!&nbsp; However,
the <i>barocco</i> apostle was a resourceful person in his way, and
we managed to get round the hard letter of it without damage to its
fine spirit.&nbsp; Yet, strictly speaking, it was not the conduct of
a good citizen; and in retrospect there is an unfilial flavour about
that early sin of mine.&nbsp; For this Act of Parliament, the Merchant
Shipping Act of the Victorian era, had been in a manner of speaking
a father and mother to me.&nbsp; For many years it had regulated and
disciplined my life, prescribed my food and the amount of my breathing
space, had looked after my health and tried as much as possible to secure
my personal safety in a risky calling.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t such a bad
thing to lead a life of hard toil and plain duty within the four corners
of an honest Act of Parliament.&nbsp; And I am glad to say that its
seventies have never been applied to me.</p>
<p>In the year 1878, the year of &ldquo;Peace with Honour,&rdquo; I
had walked as lone as any human being in the streets of London, out
of Liverpool Street Station, to surrender myself to its care.&nbsp;
And now, in the year of the war waged for honour and conscience more
than for any other cause, I was there again, no longer alone, but a
man of infinitely dear and close ties grown since that time, of work
done, of words written, of friendships secured.&nbsp; It was like the
closing of a thirty-six-year cycle.</p>
<p>All unaware of the War Angel already awaiting, with the trumpet at
his lips, the stroke of the fatal hour, I sat there, thinking that this
life of ours is neither long nor short, but that it can appear very
wonderful, entertaining, and pathetic, with symbolic images and bizarre
associations crowded into one half-hour of retrospective musing.</p>
<p>I felt, too, that this journey, so suddenly entered upon, was bound
to take me away from daily life&rsquo;s actualities at every step.&nbsp;
I felt it more than ever when presently we steamed out into the North
Sea, on a dark night fitful with gusts of wind, and I lingered on deck,
alone of all the tale of the ship&rsquo;s passengers.&nbsp; That sea
was to me something unforgettable, something much more than a name.&nbsp;
It had been for some time the schoolroom of my trade.&nbsp; On it, I
may safely say, I had learned, too, my first words of English.&nbsp;
A wild and stormy abode, sometimes, was that confined, shallow-water
academy of seamanship from which I launched myself on the wide oceans.&nbsp;
My teachers had been the sailors of the Norfolk shore; coast men, with
steady eyes, mighty limbs, and gentle voice; men of very few words,
which at least were never bare of meaning.&nbsp; Honest, strong, steady
men, sobered by domestic ties, one and all, as far as I can remember.</p>
<p>That is what years ago the North Sea I could hear growling in the
dark all round the ship had been for me.&nbsp; And I fancied that I
must have been carrying its voice in my ear ever since, for nothing
could be more familiar than those short, angry sounds I was listening
to with a smile of affectionate recognition.</p>
<p>I could not guess that before many days my old schoolroom would be
desecrated by violence, littered with wrecks, with death walking its
waves, hiding under its waters.&nbsp; Perhaps while I am writing these
words the children, or maybe the grandchildren, of my pacific teachers
are out in trawlers, under the Naval flag, dredging for German submarine
mines.</p>
<h4>III.</h4>
<p>I have said that the North Sea was my finishing school of seamanship
before I launched myself on the wider oceans.&nbsp; Confined as it is
in comparison with the vast stage of this water-girt globe, I did not
know it in all its parts.&nbsp; My class-room was the region of the
English East Coast which, in the year of Peace with Honour, had long
forgotten the war episodes belonging to its maritime history.&nbsp;
It was a peaceful coast, agricultural, industrial, the home of fishermen.&nbsp;
At night the lights of its many towns played on the clouds, or in clear
weather lay still, here and there, in brilliant pools above the ink-black
outline of the land.&nbsp; On many a night I have hauled at the braces
under the shadow of that coast, envying, as sailors will, the people
on shore sleeping quietly in their beds within sound of the sea.&nbsp;
I imagine that not one head on those envied pillows was made uneasy
by the slightest premonition of the realities of naval war the short
lifetime of one generation was to bring so close to their homes.</p>
<p>Though far away from that region of kindly memories and traversing
a part of the North Sea much less known to me, I was deeply conscious
of the familiarity of my surroundings.&nbsp; It was a cloudy, nasty
day: and the aspects of Nature don&rsquo;t change, unless in the course
of thousands of years&mdash;or, perhaps, centuries.&nbsp; The Phoenicians,
its first discoverers, the Romans, the first imperial rulers of that
sea, had experienced days like this, so different in the wintry quality
of the light, even on a July afternoon, from anything they had ever
known in their native Mediterranean.&nbsp; For myself, a very late comer
into that sea, and its former pupil, I accorded amused recognition to
the characteristic aspect so well remembered from my days of training.&nbsp;
The same old thing.&nbsp; A grey-green expanse of smudgy waters grinning
angrily at one with white foam-ridges, and over all a cheerless, unglowing
canopy, apparently made of wet blotting-paper.&nbsp; From time to time
a flurry of fine rain blew along like a puff of smoke across the dots
of distant fishing boats, very few, very scattered, and tossing restlessly
on an ever dissolving, ever re-forming sky-line.</p>
<p>Those flurries, and the steady rolling of the ship, accounted for
the emptiness of the decks, favouring my reminiscent mood.&nbsp; It
might have been a day of five and thirty years ago, when there were
on this and every other sea more sails and less smoke-stacks to be seen.&nbsp;
Yet, thanks to the unchangeable sea I could have given myself up to
the illusion of a revised past, had it not been for the periodical transit
across my gaze of a German passenger.&nbsp; He was marching round and
round the boat deck with characteristic determination.&nbsp; Two sturdy
boys gambolled round him in his progress like two disorderly satellites
round their parent planet.&nbsp; He was bringing them home, from their
school in England, for their holiday.&nbsp; What could have induced
such a sound Teuton to entrust his offspring to the unhealthy influences
of that effete, corrupt, rotten and criminal country I cannot imagine.&nbsp;
It could hardly have been from motives of economy.&nbsp; I did not speak
to him.&nbsp; He trod the deck of that decadent British ship with a
scornful foot while his breast (and to a large extent his stomach, too)
appeared expanded by the consciousness of a superior destiny.&nbsp;
Later I could observe the same truculent bearing, touched with the racial
grotesqueness, in the men of the <i>Landwehr</i> corps, that passed
through Cracow to reinforce the Austrian army in Eastern Galicia.&nbsp;
Indeed, the haughty passenger might very well have been, most probably
was, an officer of the <i>Landwehr</i>; and perhaps those two fine active
boys are orphans by now.&nbsp; Thus things acquire significance by the
lapse of time.&nbsp; A citizen, a father, a warrior, a mote in the dust-cloud
of six million fighting particles, an unconsidered trifle for the jaws
of war, his humanity was not consciously impressed on my mind at the
time.&nbsp; Mainly, for me, he was a sharp tapping of heels round the
corner of the deck-house, a white yachting cap and a green overcoat
getting periodically between my eyes and the shifting cloud-horizon
of the ashy-grey North Sea.&nbsp; He was but a shadowy intrusion and
a disregarded one, for, far away there to the West, in the direction
of the Dogger Bank, where fishermen go seeking their daily bread and
sometimes find their graves, I could behold an experience of my own
in the winter of &rsquo;81, not of war, truly, but of a fairly lively
contest with the elements which were very angry indeed.</p>
<p>There had been a troublesome week of it, including one hateful night&mdash;or
a night of hate (it isn&rsquo;t for nothing that the North Sea is also
called the German Ocean)&mdash;when all the fury stored in its heart
seemed concentrated on one ship which could do no better than float
on her side in an unnatural, disagreeable, precarious, and altogether
intolerable manner.&nbsp; There were on board, besides myself, seventeen
men all good and true, including a round enormous Dutchman who, in those
hours between sunset and sunrise, managed to lose his blown-out appearance
somehow, became as it were deflated, and thereafter for a good long
time moved in our midst wrinkled and slack all over like a half-collapsed
balloon.&nbsp; The whimpering of our deck-boy, a skinny, impressionable
little scarecrow out of a training-ship, for whom, because of the tender
immaturity of his nerves, this display of German Ocean frightfulness
was too much (before the year was out he developed into a sufficiently
cheeky young ruffian), his desolate whimpering, I say, heard between
the gusts of that black, savage night, was much more present to my mind
and indeed to my senses than the green overcoat and the white cap of
the German passenger circling the deck indefatigably, attended by his
two gyrating children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a very nice gentleman.&rdquo;&nbsp; This information,
together with the fact that he was a widower and a regular passenger
twice a year by the ship, was communicated to me suddenly by our captain.&nbsp;
At intervals through the day he would pop out of the chart-room and
offer me short snatches of conversation.&nbsp; He owned a simple soul
and a not very entertaining mind, and he was without malice and, I believe,
quite unconsciously, a warm Germanophil.&nbsp; And no wonder!&nbsp;
As he told me himself, he had been fifteen years on that run, and spent
almost as much of his life in Hamburg as in Harwich.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful people they are,&rdquo; he repeated from time to
time, without entering into particulars, but with many nods of sagacious
obstinacy.&nbsp; What he knew of them, I suppose, were a few commercial
travellers and small merchants, most likely.&nbsp; But I had observed
long before that German genius has a hypnotising power over half-baked
souls and half-lighted minds.&nbsp; There is an immense force of suggestion
in highly organised mediocrity.&nbsp; Had it not hypnotised half Europe?&nbsp;
My man was very much under the spell of German excellence.&nbsp; On
the other hand, his contempt for France was equally general and unbounded.&nbsp;
I tried to advance some arguments against this position, but I only
succeeded in making him hostile.&nbsp; &ldquo;I believe you are a Frenchman
yourself,&rdquo; he snarled at last, giving me an intensely suspicious
look; and forthwith broke off communications with a man of such unsound
sympathies.</p>
<p>Hour by hour the blotting-paper sky and the great flat greenish smudge
of the sea had been taking on a darker tone, without any change in their
colouring and texture.&nbsp; Evening was coming on over the North Sea.&nbsp;
Black uninteresting hummocks of land appeared, dotting the duskiness
of water and clouds in the Eastern board: tops of islands fringing the
German shore.&nbsp; While I was looking at their antics amongst the
waves&mdash;and for all their solidity they were very elusive things
in the failing light&mdash;another passenger came out on deck.&nbsp;
This one wore a dark overcoat and a grey cap.&nbsp; The yellow leather
strap of his binocular case crossed his chest.&nbsp; His elderly red
cheeks nourished but a very thin crop of short white hairs, and the
end of his nose was so perfectly round that it determined the whole
character of his physiognomy.&nbsp; Indeed nothing else in it had the
slightest chance to assert itself.&nbsp; His disposition, unlike the
widower&rsquo;s, appeared to be mild and humane.&nbsp; He offered me
the loan of his glasses.&nbsp; He had a wife and some small children
concealed in the depths of the ship, and he thought they were very well
where they were.&nbsp; His eldest son was about the decks somewhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are Americans,&rdquo; he remarked weightily, but in a rather
peculiar tone.&nbsp; He spoke English with the accent of our captain&rsquo;s
&ldquo;wonderful people,&rdquo; and proceeded to give me the history
of the family&rsquo;s crossing the Atlantic in a White Star liner.&nbsp;
They remained in England just the time necessary for a railway journey
from Liverpool to Harwich.&nbsp; His people (those in the depths of
the ship) were naturally a little tired.</p>
<p>At that moment a young man of about twenty, his son, rushed up to
us from the fore-deck in a state of intense elation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hurrah,&rdquo;
he cried under his breath.&nbsp; &ldquo;The first German light!&nbsp;
Hurrah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And those two American citizens shook hands on it with the greatest
fervour, while I turned away and received full in the eyes the brilliant
wink of the Borkum lighthouse squatting low down in the darkness.&nbsp;
The shade of the night had settled on the North Sea.</p>
<p>I do not think I have ever seen before a night so full of lights.&nbsp;
The great change of sea life since my time was brought home to me.&nbsp;
I had been conscious all day of an interminable procession of steamers.&nbsp;
They went on and on as if in chase of each other, the Baltic trade,
the trade of Scandinavia, of Denmark, of Germany, pitching heavily into
a head sea and bound for the gateway of Dover Straits.&nbsp; Singly,
and in small companies of two and three, they emerged from the dull,
colourless, sunless distances ahead as if the supply of rather roughly
finished mechanical toys were inexhaustible in some mysterious cheap
store away there, below the grey curve of the earth.&nbsp; Cargo steam
vessels have reached by this time a height of utilitarian ugliness which,
when one reflects that it is the product of human ingenuity, strikes
hopeless awe into one.&nbsp; These dismal creations look still uglier
at sea than in port, and with an added touch of the ridiculous.&nbsp;
Their rolling waddle when seen at a certain angle, their abrupt clockwork
nodding in a sea-way, so unlike the soaring lift and swing of a craft
under sail, have in them something caricatural, a suggestion of a low
parody directed at noble predecessors by an improved generation of dull,
mechanical toilers, conceited and without grace.</p>
<p>When they switched on (each of these unlovely cargo tanks carried
tame lightning within its slab-sided body), when they switched on their
lamps they spangled the night with the cheap, electric, shop-glitter,
here, there, and everywhere, as of some High Street, broken up and washed
out to sea.&nbsp; Later, Heligoland cut into the overhead darkness with
its powerful beam, infinitely prolonged out of unfathomable night under
the clouds.</p>
<p>I remained on deck until we stopped and a steam pilot-boat, so overlighted
amidships that one could not make out her complete shape, glided across
our bows and sent a pilot on board.&nbsp; I fear that the oar, as a
working implement, will become presently as obsolete as the sail.&nbsp;
The pilot boarded us in a motor-dinghy.&nbsp; More and more is mankind
reducing its physical activities to pulling levers and twirling little
wheels.&nbsp; Progress!&nbsp; Yet the older methods of meeting natural
forces demanded intelligence too; an equally fine readiness of wits.&nbsp;
And readiness of wits working in combination with the strength of muscles
made a more complete man.</p>
<p>It was really a surprisingly small dinghy and it ran to and fro like
a water-insect fussing noisily down there with immense self-importance.&nbsp;
Within hail of us the hull of the Elbe lightship floated all dark and
silent under its enormous round, service lantern; a faithful black shadow
watching the broad estuary full of lights.</p>
<p>Such was my first view of the Elbe approached under the wings of
peace ready for flight away from the luckless shores of Europe.&nbsp;
Our visual impressions remain with us so persistently that I find it
extremely difficult to hold fast to the rational belief that now everything
is dark over there, that the Elbe lightship has been towed away from
its post of duty, the triumphant beam of Heligoland extinguished, and
the pilot-boat laid up, or turned to warlike uses for lack of its proper
work to do.&nbsp; And obviously it must be so.</p>
<p>Any trickle of oversea trade that passes yet that way must be creeping
along cautiously with the unlighted, war-blighted black coast close
on one hand, and sudden death on the other.&nbsp; For all the space
we steamed through that Sunday evening must now be one great minefield,
sown thickly with the seeds of hate; while submarines steal out to sea,
over the very spot perhaps where the insect-dinghy put a pilot on board
of us with so much fussy importance.&nbsp; Mines; Submarines.&nbsp;
The last word in sea-warfare!&nbsp; Progress&mdash;impressively disclosed
by this war.</p>
<p>There have been other wars!&nbsp; Wars not inferior in the greatness
of the stake and in the fierce animosity of feelings.&nbsp; During that
one which was finished a hundred years ago it happened that while the
English Fleet was keeping watch on Brest, an American, perhaps Fulton
himself, offered to the Maritime Prefect of the port and to the French
Admiral, an invention which would sink all the unsuspecting English
ships one after another&mdash;or, at any rate most of them.&nbsp; The
offer was not even taken into consideration; and the Prefect ends his
report to the Minister in Paris with a fine phrase of indignation: &ldquo;It
is not the sort of death one would deal to brave men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And behold, before history had time to hatch another war of the like
proportions in the intensity of aroused passions and the greatness of
issues, the dead flavour of archaism descended on the manly sentiment
of those self-denying words.&nbsp; Mankind has been demoralised since
by its own mastery of mechanical appliances.&nbsp; Its spirit is apparently
so weak now, and its flesh has grown so strong, that it will face any
deadly horror of destruction and cannot resist the temptation to use
any stealthy, murderous contrivance.&nbsp; It has become the intoxicated
slave of its own detestable ingenuity.&nbsp; It is true, too, that since
the Napoleonic time another sort of war-doctrine has been inculcated
in a nation, and held out to the world.</p>
<h4>IV.</h4>
<p>On this journey of ours, which for me was essentially not a progress,
but a retracing of footsteps on the road of life, I had no beacons to
look for in Germany.&nbsp; I had never lingered in that land which,
on the whole, is so singularly barren of memorable manifestations of
generous sympathies and magnanimous impulses.&nbsp; An ineradicable,
invincible, provincialism of envy and vanity clings to the forms of
its thought like a frowsy garment.&nbsp; Even while yet very young I
turned my eyes away from it instinctively as from a threatening phantom.&nbsp;
I believe that children and dogs have, in their innocence, a special
power of perception as far as spectral apparitions and coming misfortunes
are concerned.</p>
<p>I let myself be carried through Germany as if it were pure space,
without sights, without sounds.&nbsp; No whispers of the war reached
my voluntary abstraction.&nbsp; And perhaps not so very voluntary after
all!&nbsp; Each of us is a fascinating spectacle to himself, and I had
to watch my own personality returning from another world, as it were,
to revisit the glimpses of old moons.&nbsp; Considering the condition
of humanity, I am, perhaps, not so much to blame for giving myself up
to that occupation.&nbsp; We prize the sensation of our continuity,
and we can only capture it in that way.&nbsp; By watching.</p>
<p>We arrived in Cracow late at night.&nbsp; After a scrambly supper,
I said to my eldest boy, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go to bed.&nbsp; I am
going out for a look round.&nbsp; Coming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was ready enough.&nbsp; For him, all this was part of the interesting
adventure of the whole journey.&nbsp; We stepped out of the portal of
the hotel into an empty street, very silent and bright with moonlight.&nbsp;
I was, indeed, revisiting the glimpses of the moon.&nbsp; I felt so
much like a ghost that the discovery that I could remember such material
things as the right turn to take and the general direction of the street
gave me a moment of wistful surprise.</p>
<p>The street, straight and narrow, ran into the great Market Square
of the town, the centre of its affairs and of the lighter side of its
life.&nbsp; We could see at the far end of the street a promising widening
of space.&nbsp; At the corner an unassuming (but armed) policeman, wearing
ceremoniously at midnight a pair of white gloves which made his big
hands extremely noticeable, turned his head to look at the grizzled
foreigner holding forth in a strange tongue to a youth on whose arm
he leaned.</p>
<p>The Square, immense in its solitude, was full to the brim of moonlight.&nbsp;
The garland of lights at the foot of the houses seemed to burn at the
bottom of a bluish pool.&nbsp; I noticed with infinite satisfaction
that the unnecessary trees the Municipality insisted upon sticking between
the stones had been steadily refusing to grow.&nbsp; They were not a
bit bigger than the poor victims I could remember.&nbsp; Also, the paving
operations seemed to be exactly at the same point at which I left them
forty years before.&nbsp; There were the dull, torn-up patches on that
bright expanse, the piles of paving material looking ominously black,
like heads of rocks on a silvery sea.&nbsp; Who was it that said that
Time works wonders?&nbsp; What an exploded superstition!&nbsp; As far
as these trees and these paving stones were concerned, it had worked
nothing.&nbsp; The suspicion of the unchangeableness of things already
vaguely suggested to my senses by our rapid drive from the railway station
was agreeably strengthened within me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are now on the line A.B.,&rdquo; I said to my companion,
importantly.</p>
<p>It was the name bestowed in my time on one of the sides of the Square
by the senior students of that town of classical learning and historical
relics.&nbsp; The common citizens knew nothing of it, and, even if they
had, would not have dreamed of taking it seriously.&nbsp; He who used
it was of the initiated, belonged to the Schools.&nbsp; We youngsters
regarded that name as a fine jest, the invention of a most excellent
fancy.&nbsp; Even as I uttered it to my boy I experienced again that
sense of my privileged initiation.&nbsp; And then, happening to look
up at the wall, I saw in the light of the corner lamp, a white, cast-iron
tablet fixed thereon, bearing an inscription in raised black letters,
thus: &ldquo;Line A.B.&rdquo;&nbsp; Heavens!&nbsp; The name had been
adopted officially!&nbsp; Any town urchin, any guttersnipe, any herb-selling
woman of the market-place, any wandering Boeotian, was free to talk
of the line A.B., to walk on the line A.B., to appoint to meet his friends
on the line A.B.&nbsp; It had become a mere name in a directory.&nbsp;
I was stunned by the extreme mutability of things.&nbsp; Time could
work wonders, and no mistake.&nbsp; A Municipality had stolen an invention
of excellent fancy, and a fine jest had turned into a horrid piece of
cast-iron.</p>
<p>I proposed that we should walk to the other end of the line, using
the profaned name, not only without gusto, but with positive distaste.&nbsp;
And this, too, was one of the wonders of Time, for a bare minute had
worked that change.&nbsp; There was at the end of the line a certain
street I wanted to look at, I explained to my companion.</p>
<p>To our right the unequal massive towers of St. Mary&rsquo;s Church
soared aloft into the ethereal radiance of the air, very black on their
shaded sides, glowing with a soft phosphorescent sheen on the others.&nbsp;
In the distance the Florian Gate, thick and squat under its pointed
roof, barred the street with the square shoulders of the old city wall.&nbsp;
In the narrow, brilliantly pale vista of bluish flagstones and silvery
fronts of houses, its black archway stood out small and very distinct.</p>
<p>There was not a soul in sight, and not even the echo of a footstep
for our ears.&nbsp; Into this coldly illuminated and dumb emptiness
there issued out of my aroused memory, a small boy of eleven, wending
his way, not very fast, to a preparatory school for day-pupils on the
second floor of the third house down from the Florian Gate.&nbsp; It
was in the winter months of 1868.&nbsp; At eight o&rsquo;clock of every
morning that God made, sleet or shine, I walked up Florian Street.&nbsp;
But of that, my first school, I remember very little.&nbsp; I believe
that one of my co-sufferers there has become a much appreciated editor
of historical documents.&nbsp; But I didn&rsquo;t suffer much from the
various imperfections of my first school.&nbsp; I was rather indifferent
to school troubles.&nbsp; I had a private gnawing worm of my own.&nbsp;
This was the time of my father&rsquo;s last illness.&nbsp; Every evening
at seven, turning my back on the Florian Gate, I walked all the way
to a big old house in a quiet narrow street a good distance beyond the
Great Square.&nbsp; There, in a large drawing-room, panelled and bare,
with heavy cornices and a lofty ceiling, in a little oasis of light
made by two candles in a desert of dusk, I sat at a little table to
worry and ink myself all over till the task of my preparation was done.&nbsp;
The table of my toil faced a tall white door, which was kept closed;
now and then it would come ajar and a nun in a white coif would squeeze
herself through the crack, glide across the room, and disappear.&nbsp;
There were two of these noiseless nursing nuns.&nbsp; Their voices were
seldom heard.&nbsp; For, indeed, what could they have had to say?&nbsp;
When they did speak to me it was with their lips hardly moving, in a
claustral, clear whisper.&nbsp; Our domestic matters were ordered by
the elderly housekeeper of our neighbour on the second floor, a Canon
of the Cathedral, lent for the emergency.&nbsp; She, too, spoke but
seldom.&nbsp; She wore a black dress with a cross hanging by a chain
on her ample bosom.&nbsp; And though when she spoke she moved her lips
more than the nuns, she never let her voice rise above a peacefully
murmuring note.&nbsp; The air around me was all piety, resignation,
and silence.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what would have become of me if I had not been
a reading boy.&nbsp; My prep. finished I would have had nothing to do
but sit and watch the awful stillness of the sick room flow out through
the closed door and coldly enfold my scared heart.&nbsp; I suppose that
in a futile childish way I would have gone crazy.&nbsp; But I was a
reading boy.&nbsp; There were many books about, lying on consoles, on
tables, and even on the floor, for we had not had time to settle down.&nbsp;
I read!&nbsp; What did I not read!&nbsp; Sometimes the elder nun, gliding
up and casting a mistrustful look on the open pages, would lay her hand
lightly on my head and suggest in a doubtful whisper, &ldquo;Perhaps
it is not very good for you to read these books.&rdquo;&nbsp; I would
raise my eyes to her face mutely, and with a vague gesture of giving
it up she would glide away.</p>
<p>Later in the evening, but not always, I would be permitted to tip-toe
into the sick room to say good-night to the figure prone on the bed,
which often could not acknowledge my presence but by a slow movement
of the eyes, put my lips dutifully to the nerveless hand lying on the
coverlet, and tip-toe out again.&nbsp; Then I would go to bed, in a
room at the end of the corridor, and often, not always, cry myself into
a good sound sleep.</p>
<p>I looked forward to what was coming with an incredulous terror.&nbsp;
I turned my eyes from it sometimes with success, and yet all the time
I had an awful sensation of the inevitable.&nbsp; I had also moments
of revolt which stripped off me some of my simple trust in the government
of the universe.&nbsp; But when the inevitable entered the sick room
and the white door was thrown wide open, I don&rsquo;t think I found
a single tear to shed.&nbsp; I have a suspicion that the Canon&rsquo;s
housekeeper looked on me as the most callous little wretch on earth.</p>
<p>The day of the funeral came in due course and all the generous &ldquo;Youth
of the Schools,&rdquo; the grave Senate of the University, the delegations
of the Trade-guilds, might have obtained (if they cared) <i>de visu</i>
evidence of the callousness of the little wretch.&nbsp; There was nothing
in my aching head but a few words, some such stupid sentences as, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
done,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s accomplished&rdquo; (in Polish it
is much shorter), or something of the sort, repeating itself endlessly.&nbsp;
The long procession moved out of the narrow street, down a long street,
past the Gothic front of St. Mary&rsquo;s under its unequal towers,
towards the Florian Gate.</p>
<p>In the moonlight-flooded silence of the old town of glorious tombs
and tragic memories, I could see again the small boy of that day following
a hearse; a space kept clear in which I walked alone, conscious of an
enormous following, the clumsy swaying of the tall black machine, the
chanting of the surpliced clergy at the head, the flames of tapers passing
under the low archway of the gate, the rows of bared heads on the pavements
with fixed, serious eyes.&nbsp; Half the population had turned out on
that fine May afternoon.&nbsp; They had not come to honour a great achievement,
or even some splendid failure.&nbsp; The dead and they were victims
alike of an unrelenting destiny which cut them off from every path of
merit and glory.&nbsp; They had come only to render homage to the ardent
fidelity of the man whose life had been a fearless confession in word
and deed of a creed which the simplest heart in that crowd could feel
and understand.</p>
<p>It seemed to me that if I remained longer there in that narrow street
I should become the helpless prey of the Shadows I had called up.&nbsp;
They were crowding upon me, enigmatic and insistent in their clinging
air of the grave that tasted of dust and of the bitter vanity of old
hopes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back to the hotel, my boy,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It will be easily understood that I neither thought nor dreamt that
night of a possible war.&nbsp; For the next two days I went about amongst
my fellow men, who welcomed me with the utmost consideration and friendliness,
but unanimously derided my fears of a war.&nbsp; They would not believe
in it.&nbsp; It was impossible.&nbsp; On the evening of the second day
I was in the hotel&rsquo;s smoking room, an irrationally private apartment,
a sanctuary for a few choice minds of the town, always pervaded by a
dim religious light, and more hushed than any club reading-room I have
ever been in.&nbsp; Gathered into a small knot, we were discussing the
situation in subdued tones suitable to the genius of the place.</p>
<p>A gentleman with a fine head of white hair suddenly pointed an impatient
finger in my direction and apostrophised me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I want to know is whether, should there be war, England
would come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The time to draw a breath, and I spoke out for the Cabinet without
faltering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most assuredly.&nbsp; I should think all Europe knows that
by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took hold of the lapel of my coat, and, giving it a slight jerk
for greater emphasis, said forcibly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, if England will, as you say, and all the world knows
it, there can be no war.&nbsp; Germany won&rsquo;t be so mad as that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the morrow by noon we read of the German ultimatum.&nbsp; The
day after came the declaration of war, and the Austrian mobilisation
order.&nbsp; We were fairly caught.&nbsp; All that remained for me to
do was to get my party out of the way of eventual shells.&nbsp; The
best move which occurred to me was to snatch them up instantly into
the mountains to a Polish health resort of great repute&mdash;which
I did (at the rate of one hundred miles in eleven hours) by the last
civilian train permitted to leave Cracow for the next three weeks.</p>
<p>And there we remained amongst the Poles from all parts of Poland,
not officially interned, but simply unable to obtain the permission
to travel by train, or road.&nbsp; It was a wonderful, a poignant two
months.&nbsp; This is not the time, and, perhaps, not the place, to
enlarge upon the tragic character of the situation; a whole people seeing
the culmination of its misfortunes in a final catastrophe, unable to
trust anyone, to appeal to anyone, to look for help from any quarter;
deprived of all hope and even of its last illusions, and unable, in
the trouble of minds and the unrest of consciences, to take refuge in
stoical acceptance.&nbsp; I have seen all this.&nbsp; And I am glad
I have not so many years left me to remember that appalling feeling
of inexorable fate, tangible, palpable, come after so many cruel years,
a figure of dread, murmuring with iron lips the final words: Ruin&mdash;and
Extinction.</p>
<p>But enough of this.&nbsp; For our little band there was the awful
anguish of incertitude as to the real nature of events in the West.&nbsp;
It is difficult to give an idea how ugly and dangerous things looked
to us over there.&nbsp; Belgium knocked down and trampled out of existence,
France giving in under repeated blows, a military collapse like that
of 1870, and England involved in that disastrous alliance, her army
sacrificed, her people in a panic!&nbsp; Polish papers, of course, had
no other but German sources of information.&nbsp; Naturally, we did
not believe all we read, but it was sometimes excessively difficult
to react with sufficient firmness.</p>
<p>We used to shut our door, and there, away from everybody, we sat
weighing the news, hunting up discrepancies, scenting lies, finding
reasons for hopefulness, and generally cheering each other up.&nbsp;
But it was a beastly time.&nbsp; People used to come to me with very
serious news and ask, &ldquo;What do you think of it?&rdquo;&nbsp; And
my invariable answer was: &ldquo;Whatever has happened, or is going
to happen, whoever wants to make peace, you may be certain that England
will not make it, not for ten years, if necessary.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>But enough of this, too.&nbsp; Through the unremitting efforts of
Polish friends we obtained at last the permission to travel to Vienna.&nbsp;
Once there, the wing of the American Eagle was extended over our uneasy
heads.&nbsp; We cannot be sufficiently grateful to the American Ambassador
(who, all along, interested himself in our fate) for his exertions on
our behalf, his invaluable assistance and the real friendliness of his
reception in Vienna.&nbsp; Owing to Mr. Penfield&rsquo;s action we obtained
the permission to leave Austria.&nbsp; And it was a near thing, for
his Excellency has informed my American publishers since that a week
later orders were issued to have us detained till the end of the war.&nbsp;
However, we effected our hair&rsquo;s-breadth escape into Italy; and,
reaching Genoa, took passage in a Dutch mail steamer, homeward-bound
from Java with London as a port of call.</p>
<p>On that sea-route I might have picked up a memory at every mile if
the past had not been eclipsed by the tremendous actuality.&nbsp; We
saw the signs of it in the emptiness of the Mediterranean, the aspect
of Gibraltar, the misty glimpse in the Bay of Biscay of an outward-bound
convoy of transports, in the presence of British submarines in the Channel.&nbsp;
Innumerable drifters flying the Naval flag dotted the narrow waters,
and two Naval officers coming on board off the South Foreland, piloted
the ship through the Downs.</p>
<p>The Downs!&nbsp; There they were, thick with the memories of my sea-life.&nbsp;
But what were to me now the futilities of an individual past?&nbsp;
As our ship&rsquo;s head swung into the estuary of the Thames, a deep,
yet faint, concussion passed through the air, a shock rather than a
sound, which missing my ear found its way straight into my heart.&nbsp;
Turning instinctively to look at my boys, I happened to meet my wife&rsquo;s
eyes.&nbsp; She also had felt profoundly, coming from far away across
the grey distances of the sea, the faint boom of the big guns at work
on the coast of Flanders&mdash;shaping the future.</p>
<h3>FIRST NEWS&mdash;1918</h3>
<p>Four years ago, on the first day of August, in the town of Cracow,
Austrian Poland, nobody would believe that the war was coming.&nbsp;
My apprehensions were met by the words: &ldquo;We have had these scares
before.&rdquo;&nbsp; This incredulity was so universal amongst people
of intelligence and information, that even I, who had accustomed myself
to look at the inevitable for years past, felt my conviction shaken.&nbsp;
At that time, it must be noted, the Austrian army was already partly
mobilised, and as we came through Austrian Silesia we had noticed all
the bridges being guarded by soldiers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Austria will back down,&rdquo; was the opinion of all the
well-informed men with whom I talked on the first of August.&nbsp; The
session of the University was ended and the students were either all
gone or going home to different parts of Poland, but the professors
had not all departed yet on their respective holidays, and amongst them
the tone of scepticism prevailed generally.&nbsp; Upon the whole there
was very little inclination to talk about the possibility of a war.&nbsp;
Nationally, the Poles felt that from their point of view there was nothing
to hope from it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whatever happens,&rdquo; said a very distinguished
man to me, &ldquo;we may be certain that it&rsquo;s our skins which
will pay for it as usual.&rdquo;&nbsp; A well-known literary critic
and writer on economical subjects said to me: &ldquo;War seems a material
impossibility, precisely because it would mean the complete ruin of
all material interests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was wrong, as we know; but those who said that Austria as usual
would back down were, as a matter of fact perfectly right.&nbsp; Austria
did back down.&nbsp; What these men did not foresee was the interference
of Germany.&nbsp; And one cannot blame them very well; for who could
guess that, when the balance stood even, the German sword would be thrown
into the scale with nothing in the open political situation to justify
that act, or rather that crime&mdash;if crime can ever be justified?&nbsp;
For, as the same intelligent man said to me: &ldquo;As it is, those
people&rdquo; (meaning Germans) &ldquo;have very nearly the whole world
in their economic grip.&nbsp; Their prestige is even greater than their
actual strength.&nbsp; It can get for them practically everything they
want.&nbsp; Then why risk it?&rdquo;&nbsp; And there was no apparent
answer to the question put in that way.&nbsp; I must also say that the
Poles had no illusions about the strength of Russia.&nbsp; Those illusions
were the monopoly of the Western world.</p>
<p>Next day the librarian of the University invited me to come and have
a look at the library which I had not seen since I was fourteen years
old.&nbsp; It was from him that I learned that the greater part of my
father&rsquo;s MSS. was preserved there.&nbsp; He confessed that he
had not looked them through thoroughly yet, but he told me that there
was a lot of very important letters bearing on the epoch from &rsquo;60
to &rsquo;63, to and from many prominent Poles of that time: and he
added: &ldquo;There is a bundle of correspondence that will appeal to
you personally.&nbsp; Those are letters written by your father to an
intimate friend in whose papers they were found.&nbsp; They contain
many references to yourself, though you couldn&rsquo;t have been more
than four years old at the time.&nbsp; Your father seems to have been
extremely interested in his son.&rdquo;&nbsp; That afternoon I went
to the University, taking with me <i>my</i> eldest son.&nbsp; The attention
of that young Englishman was mainly attracted by some relics of Copernicus
in a glass case.&nbsp; I saw the bundle of letters and accepted the
kind proposal of the librarian that he should have them copied for me
during the holidays.&nbsp; In the range of the deserted vaulted rooms
lined with books, full of august memories, and in the passionless silence
of all this enshrined wisdom, we walked here and there talking of the
past, the great historical past in which lived the inextinguishable
spark of national life; and all around us the centuries-old buildings
lay still and empty, composing themselves to rest after a year of work
on the minds of another generation.</p>
<p>No echo of the German ultimatum to Russia penetrated that academical
peace.&nbsp; But the news had come.&nbsp; When we stepped into the street
out of the deserted main quadrangle, we three, I imagine, were the only
people in the town who did not know of it.&nbsp; My boy and I parted
from the librarian (who hurried home to pack up for his holiday) and
walked on to the hotel, where we found my wife actually in the car waiting
for us to take a run of some ten miles to the country house of an old
school-friend of mine.&nbsp; He had been my greatest chum.&nbsp; In
my wanderings about the world I had heard that his later career both
at school and at the University had been of extraordinary brilliance&mdash;in
classics, I believe.&nbsp; But in this, the iron-grey moustache period
of his life, he informed me with badly concealed pride that he had gained
world fame as the Inventor&mdash;no, Inventor is not the word&mdash;Producer,
I believe would be the right term&mdash;of a wonderful kind of beetroot
seed.&nbsp; The beet grown from this seed contained more sugar to the
square inch&mdash;or was it to the square root?&mdash;than any other
kind of beet.&nbsp; He exported this seed, not only with profit (and
even to the United States), but with a certain amount of glory which
seemed to have gone slightly to his head.&nbsp; There is a fundamental
strain of agriculturalist in a Pole which no amount of brilliance, even
classical, can destroy.&nbsp; While we were having tea outside, looking
down the lovely slope of the gardens at the view of the city in the
distance, the possibilities of the war faded from our minds.&nbsp; Suddenly
my friend&rsquo;s wife came to us with a telegram in her hand and said
calmly: &ldquo;General mobilisation, do you know?&rdquo;&nbsp; We looked
at her like men aroused from a dream.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she insisted,
&ldquo;they are already taking the horses out of the ploughs and carts.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I said: &ldquo;We had better go back to town as quick as we can,&rdquo;
and my friend assented with a troubled look: &ldquo;Yes, you had better.&rdquo;&nbsp;
As we passed through villages on our way back we saw mobs of horses
assembled on the commons with soldiers guarding them, and groups of
villagers looking on silently at the officers with their note-books
checking deliveries and writing out receipts.&nbsp; Some old peasant
women were already weeping aloud.</p>
<p>When our car drew up at the door of the hotel, the manager himself
came to help my wife out.&nbsp; In the first moment I did not quite
recognise him.&nbsp; His luxuriant black locks were gone, his head was
closely cropped, and as I glanced at it he smiled and said: &ldquo;I
shall sleep at the barracks to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I cannot reproduce the atmosphere of that night, the first night
after mobilisation.&nbsp; The shops and the gateways of the houses were
of course closed, but all through the dark hours the town hummed with
voices; the echoes of distant shouts entered the open windows of our
bedroom.&nbsp; Groups of men talking noisily walked in the middle of
the roadway escorted by distressed women: men of all callings and of
all classes going to report themselves at the fortress.&nbsp; Now and
then a military car tooting furiously would whisk through the streets
empty of wheeled traffic, like an intensely black shadow under the great
flood of electric lights on the grey pavement.</p>
<p>But what produced the greatest impression on my mind was a gathering
at night in the coffee-room of my hotel of a few men of mark whom I
was asked to join.&nbsp; It was about one o&rsquo;clock in the morning.&nbsp;
The shutters were up.&nbsp; For some reason or other the electric light
was not switched on, and the big room was lit up only by a few tall
candles, just enough for us to see each other&rsquo;s faces by.&nbsp;
I saw in those faces the awful desolation of men whose country, torn
in three, found itself engaged in the contest with no will of its own,
and not even the power to assert itself at the cost of life.&nbsp; All
the past was gone, and there was no future, whatever happened; no road
which did not seem to lead to moral annihilation.&nbsp; I remember one
of those men addressing me after a period of mournful silence compounded
of mental exhaustion and unexpressed forebodings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think England will do?&nbsp; If there is a ray
of hope anywhere it is only there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said: &ldquo;I believe I know what England will do&rdquo; (this
was before the news of the violation of Belgian neutrality arrived),
&ldquo;though I won&rsquo;t tell you, for I am not absolutely certain.&nbsp;
But I can tell you what I am absolutely certain of.&nbsp; It is this:
If England comes into the war, then, no matter who may want to make
peace at the end of six months at the cost of right and justice, England
will keep on fighting for years if necessary.&nbsp; You may reckon on
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, even alone?&rdquo; asked somebody across the room.</p>
<p>I said: &ldquo;Yes, even alone.&nbsp; But if things go so far as
that England will not be alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think that at that moment I must have been inspired.</p>
<h3>WELL DONE&mdash;1918</h3>
<h4>I.</h4>
<p>It can be safely said that for the last four years the seamen of
Great Britain have done well.&nbsp; I mean that every kind and sort
of human being classified as seaman, steward, foremast hand, fireman,
lamp-trimmer, mate, master, engineer, and also all through the innumerable
ratings of the Navy up to that of Admiral, has done well.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
say marvellously well or miraculously well or wonderfully well or even
very well, because these are simply over-statements of undisciplined
minds.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t deny that a man may be a marvellous being,
but this is not likely to be discovered in his lifetime, and not always
even after he is dead.&nbsp; Man&rsquo;s marvellousness is a hidden
thing, because the secrets of his heart are not to be read by his fellows.&nbsp;
As to a man&rsquo;s work, if it is done well it is the very utmost that
can be said.&nbsp; You can do well, and you can do no more for people
to see.&nbsp; In the Navy, where human values are thoroughly understood,
the highest signal of commendation complimenting a ship (that is, a
ship&rsquo;s company) on some achievements consists exactly of those
two simple words &ldquo;Well done,&rdquo; followed by the name of the
ship.&nbsp; Not marvellously done, astonishingly done, wonderfully done&mdash;no,
only just:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well done, so-and-so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And to the men it is a matter of infinite pride that somebody should
judge it proper to mention aloud, as it were, that they have done well.&nbsp;
It is a memorable occurrence, for in the sea services you are expected
professionally and as a matter of course to do well, because nothing
less will do.&nbsp; And in sober speech no man can be expected to do
more than well.&nbsp; The superlatives are mere signs of uninformed
wonder.&nbsp; Thus the official signal which can express nothing but
a delicate share of appreciation becomes a great honour.</p>
<p>Speaking now as a purely civil seaman (or, perhaps, I ought to say
civilian, because politeness is not what I have in my mind) I may say
that I have never expected the Merchant Service to do otherwise than
well during the war.&nbsp; There were people who obviously did not feel
the same confidence, nay, who even confidently expected to see the collapse
of merchant seamen&rsquo;s courage.&nbsp; I must admit that such pronouncements
did arrest my attention.&nbsp; In my time I have never been able to
detect any faint hearts in the ships&rsquo; companies with whom I have
served in various capacities.&nbsp; But I reflected that I had left
the sea in &rsquo;94, twenty years before the outbreak of the war that
was to apply its severe test to the quality of modern seamen.&nbsp;
Perhaps they had deteriorated, I said unwillingly to myself.&nbsp; I
remembered also the alarmist articles I had read about the great number
of foreigners in the British Merchant Service, and I didn&rsquo;t know
how far these lamentations were justified.</p>
<p>In my time the proportion of non-Britishers in the crews of the ships
flying the red ensign was rather under one-third, which, as a matter
of fact, was less than the proportion allowed under the very strict
French navigation laws for the crews of the ships of that nation.&nbsp;
For the strictest laws aiming at the preservation of national seamen
had to recognise the difficulties of manning merchant ships all over
the world.&nbsp; The one-third of the French law seemed to be the irreducible
minimum.&nbsp; But the British proportion was even less.&nbsp; Thus
it may be said that up to the date I have mentioned the crews of British
merchant ships engaged in deep water voyages to Australia, to the East
Indies and round the Horn were essentially British.&nbsp; The small
proportion of foreigners which I remember were mostly Scandinavians,
and my general impression remains that those men were good stuff.&nbsp;
They appeared always able and ready to do their duty by the flag under
which they served.&nbsp; The majority were Norwegians, whose courage
and straightness of character are matters beyond doubt.&nbsp; I remember
also a couple of Finns, both carpenters, of course, and very good craftsmen;
a Swede, the most scientific sailmaker I ever met; another Swede, a
steward, who really might have been called a British seaman since he
had sailed out of London for over thirty years, a rather superior person;
one Italian, an everlastingly smiling but a pugnacious character; one
Frenchman, a most excellent sailor, tireless and indomitable under very
difficult circumstances; one Hollander, whose placid manner of looking
at the ship going to pieces under our feet I shall never forget, and
one young, colourless, muscularly very strong German, of no particular
character.&nbsp; Of non-European crews, lascars and Kalashes, I have
had very little experience, and that was only in one steamship and for
something less than a year.&nbsp; It was on the same occasion that I
had my only sight of Chinese firemen.&nbsp; Sight is the exact word.&nbsp;
One didn&rsquo;t speak to them.&nbsp; One saw them going along the decks,
to and fro, characteristic figures with rolled-up pigtails, very dirty
when coming off duty and very clean-faced when going on duty.&nbsp;
They never looked at anybody, and one never had occasion to address
them directly.&nbsp; Their appearances in the light of day were very
regular, and yet somewhat ghostlike in their detachment and silence.</p>
<p>But of the white crews of British ships and almost exclusively British
in blood and descent, the immediate predecessors of the men whose worth
the nation has discovered for itself to-day, I have had a thorough experience.&nbsp;
At first amongst them, then with them, I have shared all the conditions
of their very special life.&nbsp; For it was very special.&nbsp; In
my early days, starting out on a voyage was like being launched into
Eternity.&nbsp; I say advisedly Eternity instead of Space, because of
the boundless silence which swallowed up one for eighty days&mdash;for
one hundred days&mdash;for even yet more days of an existence without
echoes and whispers.&nbsp; Like Eternity itself!&nbsp; For one can&rsquo;t
conceive a vocal Eternity.&nbsp; An enormous silence, in which there
was nothing to connect one with the Universe but the incessant wheeling
about of the sun and other celestial bodies, the alternation of light
and shadow, eternally chasing each other over the sky.&nbsp; The time
of the earth, though most carefully recorded by the half-hourly bells,
did not count in reality.</p>
<p>It was a special life, and the men were a very special kind of men.&nbsp;
By this I don&rsquo;t mean to say they were more complex than the generality
of mankind.&nbsp; Neither were they very much simpler.&nbsp; I have
already admitted that man is a marvellous creature, and no doubt those
particular men were marvellous enough in their way.&nbsp; But in their
collective capacity they can be best defined as men who lived under
the command to do well, or perish utterly.&nbsp; I have written of them
with all the truth that was in me, and with an the impartiality of which
I was capable.&nbsp; Let me not be misunderstood in this statement.&nbsp;
Affection can be very exacting, and can easily miss fairness on the
critical side.&nbsp; I have looked upon them with a jealous eye, expecting
perhaps even more than it was strictly fair to expect.&nbsp; And no
wonder&mdash;since I had elected to be one of them very deliberately,
very completely, without any looking back or looking elsewhere.&nbsp;
The circumstances were such as to give me the feeling of complete identification,
a very vivid comprehension that if I wasn&rsquo;t one of them I was
nothing at all.&nbsp; But what was most difficult to detect was the
nature of the deep impulses which these men obeyed.&nbsp; What spirit
was it that inspired the unfailing manifestations of their simple fidelity?&nbsp;
No outward cohesive force of compulsion or discipline was holding them
together or had ever shaped their unexpressed standards.&nbsp; It was
very mysterious.&nbsp; At last I came to the conclusion that it must
be something in the nature of the life itself; the sea-life chosen blindly,
embraced for the most part accidentally by those men who appeared but
a loose agglomeration of individuals toiling for their living away from
the eyes of mankind.&nbsp; Who can tell how a tradition comes into the
world?&nbsp; We are children of the earth.&nbsp; It may be that the
noblest tradition is but the offspring of material conditions, of the
hard necessities besetting men&rsquo;s precarious lives.&nbsp; But once
it has been born it becomes a spirit.&nbsp; Nothing can extinguish its
force then.&nbsp; Clouds of greedy selfishness, the subtle dialectics
of revolt or fear, may obscure it for a time, but in very truth it remains
an immortal ruler invested with the power of honour and shame.</p>
<h4>II.</h4>
<p>The mysteriously born tradition of sea-craft commands unity in a
body of workers engaged in an occupation in which men have to depend
upon each other.&nbsp; It raises them, so to speak, above the frailties
of their dead selves.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t wish to be suspected of lack
of judgment and of blind enthusiasm.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t claim special
morality or even special manliness for the men who in my time really
lived at sea, and at the present time live at any rate mostly at sea.&nbsp;
But in their qualities as well as in their defects, in their weaknesses
as well as in their &ldquo;virtue,&rdquo; there was indubitably something
apart.&nbsp; They were never exactly of the earth earthly.&nbsp; They
couldn&rsquo;t be that.&nbsp; Chance or desire (mostly desire) had set
them apart, often in their very childhood; and what is to be remarked
is that from the very nature of things this early appeal, this early
desire, had to be of an imaginative kind.&nbsp; Thus their simple minds
had a sort of sweetness.&nbsp; They were in a way preserved.&nbsp; I
am not alluding here to the preserving qualities of the salt in the
sea.&nbsp; The salt of the sea is a very good thing in its way; it preserves
for instance one from catching a beastly cold while one remains wet
for weeks together in the &ldquo;roaring forties.&rdquo;&nbsp; But in
sober unpoetical truth the sea-salt never gets much further than the
seaman&rsquo;s skin, which in certain latitudes it takes the opportunity
to encrust very thoroughly.&nbsp; That and nothing more.&nbsp; And then,
what is this sea, the subject of so many apostrophes in verse and prose
addressed to its greatness and its mystery by men who had never penetrated
either the one or the other?&nbsp; The sea is uncertain, arbitrary,
featureless, and violent.&nbsp; Except when helped by the varied majesty
of the sky, there is something inane in its serenity and something stupid
in its wrath, which is endless, boundless, persistent, and futile&mdash;a
grey, hoary thing raging like an old ogre uncertain of its prey.&nbsp;
Its very immensity is wearisome.&nbsp; At any time within the navigating
centuries mankind might have addressed it with the words: &ldquo;What
are you, after all?&nbsp; Oh, yes, we know.&nbsp; The greatest scene
of potential terror, a devouring enigma of space.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; But
our lives have been nothing if not a continuous defiance of what you
can do and what you may hold; a spiritual and material defiance carried
on in our plucky cockleshells on and on beyond the successive provocations
of your unreadable horizons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah, but the charm of the sea!&nbsp; Oh, yes, charm enough.&nbsp;
Or rather a sort of unholy fascination as of an elusive nymph whose
embrace is death, and a Medusa&rsquo;s head whose stare is terror.&nbsp;
That sort of charm is calculated to keep men morally in order.&nbsp;
But as to sea-salt, with its particular bitterness like nothing else
on earth, that, I am safe to say, penetrates no further than the seamen&rsquo;s
lips.&nbsp; With them the inner soundness is caused by another kind
of preservative of which (nobody will be surprised to hear) the main
ingredient is a certain kind of love that has nothing to do with the
futile smiles and the futile passions of the sea.</p>
<p>Being love this feeling is naturally naive and imaginative.&nbsp;
It has also in it that strain of fantasy that is so often, nay almost
invariably, to be found in the temperament of a true seaman.&nbsp; But
I repeat that I claim no particular morality for seamen.&nbsp; I will
admit without difficulty that I have found amongst them the usual defects
of mankind, characters not quite straight, uncertain tempers, vacillating
wills, capriciousness, small meannesses; all this coming out mostly
on the contact with the shore; and all rather naive, peculiar, a little
fantastic.&nbsp; I have even had a downright thief in my experience.&nbsp;
One.</p>
<p>This is indeed a minute proportion, but it might have been my luck;
and since I am writing in eulogy of seamen I feel irresistibly tempted
to talk about this unique specimen; not indeed to offer him as an example
of morality, but to bring out certain characteristics and set out a
certain point of view.&nbsp; He was a large, strong man with a guileless
countenance, not very communicative with his shipmates, but when drawn
into any sort of conversation displaying a very painstaking earnestness.&nbsp;
He was fair and candid-eyed, of a very satisfactory smartness, and,
from the officer-of-the-watch point of view,&mdash;altogether dependable.&nbsp;
Then, suddenly, he went and stole.&nbsp; And he didn&rsquo;t go away
from his honourable kind to do that thing to somebody on shore; he stole
right there on the spot, in proximity to his shipmates, on board his
own ship, with complete disregard for old Brown, our night watchman
(whose fame for trustworthiness was utterly blasted for the rest of
the voyage) and in such a way as to bring the profoundest possible trouble
to all the blameless souls animating that ship.&nbsp; He stole eleven
golden sovereigns, and a gold pocket chronometer and chain.&nbsp; I
am really in doubt whether the crime should not be entered under the
category of sacrilege rather than theft.&nbsp; Those things belonged
to the captain!&nbsp; There was certainly something in the nature of
the violation of a sanctuary, and of a particularly impudent kind, too,
because he got his plunder out of the captain&rsquo;s state-room while
the captain was asleep there.&nbsp; But look, now, at the fantasy of
the man!&nbsp; After going through the pockets of the clothes, he did
not hasten to retreat.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; He went deliberately into the
saloon and removed from the sideboard two big heavy, silver-plated lamps,
which he carried to the fore-end of the ship and stood symmetrically
on the knight-heads.&nbsp; This, I must explain, means that he took
them away as far as possible from the place where they belonged.&nbsp;
These were the deeds of darkness.&nbsp; In the morning the bo&rsquo;sun
came along dragging after him a hose to wash the foc&rsquo;sle head,
and, beholding the shiny cabin lamps, resplendent in the morning light,
one on each side of the bowsprit, he was paralysed with awe.&nbsp; He
dropped the nozzle from his nerveless hands&mdash;and such hands, too!&nbsp;
I happened along, and he said to me in a distracted whisper: &ldquo;Look
at that, sir, look.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Take them back aft at once yourself,&rdquo;
I said, very amazed, too.&nbsp; As we approached the quarterdeck we
perceived the steward, a prey to a sort of sacred horror, holding up
before us the captain&rsquo;s trousers.</p>
<p>Bronzed men with brooms and buckets in their hands stood about with
open mouths.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have found them lying in the passage outside
the captain&rsquo;s door,&rdquo; the steward declared faintly.&nbsp;
The additional statement that the captain&rsquo;s watch was gone from
its hook by the bedside raised the painful sensation to the highest
pitch.&nbsp; We knew then we had a thief amongst us.&nbsp; Our thief!&nbsp;
Behold the solidarity of a ship&rsquo;s company.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t
be to us like any other thief.&nbsp; We all had to live under the shadow
of his crime for days; but the police kept on investigating, and one
morning a young woman appeared on board swinging a parasol, attended
by two policemen, and identified the culprit.&nbsp; She was a barmaid
of some bar near the Circular Quay, and knew really nothing of our man
except that he looked like a respectable sailor.&nbsp; She had seen
him only twice in her life.&nbsp; On the second occasion he begged her
nicely as a great favour to take care for him of a small solidly tied-up
paper parcel for a day or two.&nbsp; But he never came near her again.&nbsp;
At the end of three weeks she opened it, and, of course, seeing the
contents, was much alarmed, and went to the nearest police-station for
advice.&nbsp; The police took her at once on board our ship, where all
hands were mustered on the quarterdeck.&nbsp; She stared wildly at all
our faces, pointed suddenly a finger with a shriek, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
the man,&rdquo; and incontinently went off into a fit of hysterics in
front of thirty-six seamen.&nbsp; I must say that never in my life did
I see a ship&rsquo;s company look so frightened.&nbsp; Yes, in this
tale of guilt, there was a curious absence of mere criminality, and
a touch of that fantasy which is often a part of a seaman&rsquo;s character.&nbsp;
It wasn&rsquo;t greed that moved him, I think.&nbsp; It was something
much less simple: boredom, perhaps, or a bet, or the pleasure of defiance.</p>
<p>And now for the point of view.&nbsp; It was given to me by a short,
black-bearded A.B. of the crew, who on sea passages washed my flannel
shirts, mended my clothes and, generally, looked after my room.&nbsp;
He was an excellent needleman and washerman, and a very good sailor.&nbsp;
Standing in this peculiar relation to me, he considered himself privileged
to open his mind on the matter one evening when he brought back to my
cabin three clean and neatly folded shirts.&nbsp; He was profoundly
pained.&nbsp; He said: &ldquo;What a ship&rsquo;s company!&nbsp; Never
seen such a crowd!&nbsp; Liars, cheats, thieves. . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a needlessly jaundiced view.&nbsp; There were in that ship&rsquo;s
company three or four fellows who dealt in tall yarns, and I knew that
on the passage out there had been a dispute over a game in the foc&rsquo;sle
once or twice of a rather acute kind, so that all card-playing had to
be abandoned.&nbsp; In regard to thieves, as we know, there was only
one, and he, I am convinced, came out of his reserve to perform an exploit
rather than to commit a crime.&nbsp; But my black-bearded friend&rsquo;s
indignation had its special morality, for he added, with a burst of
passion: &ldquo;And on board our ship, too&mdash;a ship like this. .
.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Therein lies the secret of the seamen&rsquo;s special character as
a body.&nbsp; The ship, this ship, our ship, the ship we serve, is the
moral symbol of our life.&nbsp; A ship has to be respected, actually
and ideally; her merit, her innocence, are sacred things.&nbsp; Of all
the creations of man she is the closest partner of his toil and courage.&nbsp;
From every point of view it is imperative that you should do well by
her.&nbsp; And, as always in the case of true love, all you can do for
her adds only to the tale of her merits in your heart.&nbsp; Mute and
compelling, she claims not only your fidelity, but your respect.&nbsp;
And the supreme &ldquo;Well done!&rdquo; which you may earn is made
over to her.</p>
<h4>III.</h4>
<p>It is my deep conviction, or, perhaps, I ought to say my deep feeling
born from personal experience, that it is not the sea but the ships
of the sea that guide and command that spirit of adventure which some
say is the second nature of British men.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want to
provoke a controversy (for intellectually I am rather a Quietist) but
I venture to affirm that the main characteristic of the British men
spread all over the world, is not the spirit of adventure so much as
the spirit of service.&nbsp; I think that this could be demonstrated
from the history of great voyages and the general activity of the race.&nbsp;
That the British man has always liked his service to be adventurous
rather than otherwise cannot be denied, for each British man began by
being young in his time when all risk has a glamour.&nbsp; Afterwards,
with the course of years, risk became a part of his daily work; he would
have missed it from his side as one misses a loved companion.</p>
<p>The mere love of adventure is no saving grace.&nbsp; It is no grace
at all.&nbsp; It lays a man under no obligation of faithfulness to an
idea and even to his own self.&nbsp; Roughly speaking, an adventurer
may be expected to have courage, or at any rate may be said to need
it.&nbsp; But courage in itself is not an ideal.&nbsp; A successful
highwayman showed courage of a sort, and pirate crews have been known
to fight with courage or perhaps only with reckless desperation in the
manner of cornered rats.&nbsp; There is nothing in the world to prevent
a mere lover or pursuer of adventure from running at any moment.&nbsp;
There is his own self, his mere taste for excitement, the prospect of
some sort of gain, but there is no sort of loyalty to bind him in honour
to consistent conduct.&nbsp; I have noticed that the majority of mere
lovers of adventure are mightily careful of their skins; and the proof
of it is that so many of them manage to keep it whole to an advanced
age.&nbsp; You find them in mysterious nooks of islands and continents,
mostly red-nosed and watery-eyed, and not even amusingly boastful.&nbsp;
There is nothing more futile under the sun than a mere adventurer.&nbsp;
He might have loved at one time&mdash;which would have been a saving
grace.&nbsp; I mean loved adventure for itself.&nbsp; But if so, he
was bound to lose this grace very soon.&nbsp; Adventure by itself is
but a phantom, a dubious shape without a heart.&nbsp; Yes, there is
nothing more futile than an adventurer; but nobody can say that the
adventurous activities of the British race are stamped with the futility
of a chase after mere emotions.</p>
<p>The successive generations that went out to sea from these Isles
went out to toil desperately in adventurous conditions.&nbsp; A man
is a worker.&nbsp; If he is not that he is nothing.&nbsp; Just nothing&mdash;like
a mere adventurer.&nbsp; Those men understood the nature of their work,
but more or less dimly, in various degrees of imperfection.&nbsp; The
best and greatest of their leaders even had never seen it clearly, because
of its magnitude and the remoteness of its end.&nbsp; This is the common
fate of mankind, whose most positive achievements are born from dreams
and visions followed loyally to an unknown destination.&nbsp; And it
doesn&rsquo;t matter.&nbsp; For the great mass of mankind the only saving
grace that is needed is steady fidelity to what is nearest to hand and
heart in the short moment of each human effort.&nbsp; In other and in
greater words, what is needed is a sense of immediate duty, and a feeling
of impalpable constraint.&nbsp; Indeed, seamen and duty are all the
time inseparable companions.&nbsp; It has been suggested to me that
this sense of duty is not a patriotic sense or a religious sense, or
even a social sense in a seaman.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; It
seems to me that a seaman&rsquo;s duty may be an unconscious compound
of these three, something perhaps smaller than either, but something
much more definite for the simple mind and more adapted to the humbleness
of the seaman&rsquo;s task.&nbsp; It has been suggested also to me that
the impalpable constraint is put upon the nature of a seaman by the
Spirit of the Sea, which he serves with a dumb and dogged devotion.</p>
<p>Those are fine words conveying a fine idea.&nbsp; But this I do know,
that it is very difficult to display a dogged devotion to a mere spirit,
however great.&nbsp; In everyday life ordinary men require something
much more material, effective, definite and symbolic on which to concentrate
their love and their devotion.&nbsp; And then, what is it, this Spirit
of the Sea?&nbsp; It is too great and too elusive to be embraced and
taken to a human breast.&nbsp; All that a guileless or guileful seaman
knows of it is its hostility, its exaction of toil as endless as its
ever-renewed horizons.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; What awakens the seaman&rsquo;s
sense of duty, what lays that impalpable constraint upon the strength
of his manliness, what commands his not always dumb if always dogged
devotion, is not the spirit of the sea but something that in his eyes
has a body, a character, a fascination, and almost a soul&mdash;it is
his ship.</p>
<p>There is not a day that has passed for many centuries now without
the sun seeing scattered over all the seas groups of British men whose
material and moral existence is conditioned by their loyalty to each
other and their faithful devotion to a ship.</p>
<p>Each age has sent its contingent, not of sons (for the great mass
of seamen have always been a childless lot) but of loyal and obscure
successors taking up the modest but spiritual inheritance of a hard
life and simple duties; of duties so simple that nothing ever could
shake the traditional attitude born from the physical conditions of
the service.&nbsp; It was always the ship, bound on any possible errand
in the service of the nation, that has been the stage for the exercise
of seamen&rsquo;s primitive virtues.&nbsp; The dimness of great distances
and the obscurity of lives protected them from the nation&rsquo;s admiring
gaze.&nbsp; Those scattered distant ships&rsquo; companies seemed to
the eyes of the earth only one degree removed (on the right side, I
suppose) from the other strange monsters of the deep.&nbsp; If spoken
of at all they were spoken of in tones of half-contemptuous indulgence.&nbsp;
A good many years ago it was my lot to write about one of those ships&rsquo;
companies on a certain sea, under certain circumstances, in a book of
no particular length.</p>
<p>That small group of men whom I tried to limn with loving care, but
sparing none of their weaknesses, was characterised by a friendly reviewer
as a lot of engaging ruffians.&nbsp; This gave me some food for thought.&nbsp;
Was it, then, in that guise that they appeared through the mists of
the sea, distant, perplexed, and simple-minded?&nbsp; And what on earth
is an &ldquo;engaging ruffian&rdquo;?&nbsp; He must be a creature of
literary imagination, I thought, for the two words don&rsquo;t match
in my personal experience.&nbsp; It has happened to me to meet a few
ruffians here and there, but I never found one of them &ldquo;engaging.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I consoled myself, however, by the reflection that the friendly reviewer
must have been talking like a parrot, which so often seems to understand
what it says.</p>
<p>Yes, in the mists of the sea, and in their remoteness from the rest
of the race, the shapes of those men appeared distorted, uncouth and
faint&mdash;so faint as to be almost invisible.&nbsp; It needed the
lurid light of the engines of war to bring them out into full view,
very simple, without worldly graces, organised now into a body of workers
by the genius of one of themselves, who gave them a place and a voice
in the social scheme; but in the main still apart in their homeless,
childless generations, scattered in loyal groups over all the seas,
giving faithful care to their ships and serving the nation, which, since
they are seamen, can give them no reward but the supreme &ldquo;Well
Done.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>TRADITION&mdash;1918</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Work is the law.&nbsp; Like iron that lying idle degenerates
into a mass of useless rust, like water that in an unruffled pool sickens
into a stagnant and corrupt state, so without action the spirit of men
turns to a dead thing, loses its force, ceases prompting us to leave
some trace of ourselves on this earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; The sense of the
above lines does not belong to me.&nbsp; It may be found in the note-books
of one of the greatest artists that ever lived, Leonardo da Vinci.&nbsp;
It has a simplicity and a truth which no amount of subtle comment can
destroy.</p>
<p>The Master who had meditated so deeply on the rebirth of arts and
sciences, on the inward beauty of all things,&mdash;ships&rsquo; lines,
women&rsquo;s faces&mdash;and on the visible aspects of nature was profoundly
right in his pronouncement on the work that is done on the earth.&nbsp;
From the hard work of men are born the sympathetic consciousness of
a common destiny, the fidelity to right practice which makes great craftsmen,
the sense of right conduct which we may call honour, the devotion to
our calling and the idealism which is not a misty, winged angel without
eyes, but a divine figure of terrestrial aspect with a clear glance
and with its feet resting firmly on the earth on which it was born.</p>
<p>And work will overcome all evil, except ignorance, which is the condition
of humanity and, like the ambient air, fills the space between the various
sorts and conditions of men, which breeds hatred, fear, and contempt
between the masses of mankind, and puts on men&rsquo;s lips, on their
innocent lips, words that are thoughtless and vain.</p>
<p>Thoughtless, for instance, were the words that (in all innocence,
I believe) came on the lips of a prominent statesman making in the House
of Commons an eulogistic reference to the British Merchant Service.&nbsp;
In this name I include men of diverse status and origin, who live on
and by the sea, by it exclusively, outside all professional pretensions
and social formulas, men for whom not only their daily bread but their
collective character, their personal achievement and their individual
merit come from the sea.&nbsp; Those words of the statesman were meant
kindly; but, after all, this is not a complete excuse.&nbsp; Rightly
or wrongly, we expect from a man of national importance a larger and
at the same time a more scrupulous precision of speech, for it is possible
that it may go echoing down the ages.&nbsp; His words were:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is right when thinking of the Navy not to forget the men
of the Merchant Service, who have shown&mdash;and it is more surprising
because they have had no traditions towards it&mdash;courage as great,&rdquo;
etc., etc.</p>
<p>And then he went on talking of the execution of Captain Fryatt, an
event of undying memory, but less connected with the permanent, unchangeable
conditions of sea service than with the wrong view German minds delight
in taking of Englishmen&rsquo;s psychology.&nbsp; The enemy, he said,
meant by this atrocity to frighten our sailors away from the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo; he goes on to ask.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never
at any time in peace have sailors stayed so short a time ashore or shown
such a readiness to step again into a ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which means, in other words, that they answered to the call.&nbsp;
I should like to know at what time of history the English Merchant Service,
the great body of merchant seamen, had failed to answer the call.&nbsp;
Noticed or unnoticed, ignored or commanded, they have answered invariably
the call to do their work, the very conditions of which made them what
they are.&nbsp; They have always served the nation&rsquo;s needs through
their own invariable fidelity to the demands of their special life;
but with the development and complexity of material civilisation they
grew less prominent to the nation&rsquo;s eye among all the vast schemes
of national industry.&nbsp; Never was the need greater and the call
to the services more urgent than to-day.&nbsp; And those inconspicuous
workers on whose qualities depends so much of the national welfare have
answered it without dismay, facing risk without glory, in the perfect
faithfulness to that tradition which the speech of the statesman denies
to them at the very moment when he thinks fit to praise their courage
. . . and mention his surprise!</p>
<p>The hour of opportunity has struck&mdash;not for the first time&mdash;for
the Merchant Service; and if I associate myself with all my heart in
the admiration and the praise which is the greatest reward of brave
men I must be excused from joining in any sentiment of surprise.&nbsp;
It is perhaps because I have not been born to the inheritance of that
tradition, which has yet fashioned the fundamental part of my character
in my young days, that I am so consciously aware of it and venture to
vindicate its existence in this outspoken manner.</p>
<p>Merchant seamen have always been what they are now, from their earliest
days, before the Royal Navy had been fashioned out of the material they
furnished for the hands of kings and statesmen.&nbsp; Their work has
made them, as work undertaken with single-minded devotion makes men,
giving to their achievements that vitality and continuity in which their
souls are expressed, tempered and matured through the succeeding generations.&nbsp;
In its simplest definition the work of merchant seamen has been to take
ships entrusted to their care from port to port across the seas; and,
from the highest to the lowest, to watch and labour with devotion for
the safety of the property and the lives committed to their skill and
fortitude through the hazards of innumerable voyages.</p>
<p>That was always the clear task, the single aim, the simple ideal,
the only problem for an unselfish solution.&nbsp; The terms of it have
changed with the years, its risks have worn different aspects from time
to time.&nbsp; There are no longer any unexplored seas.&nbsp; Human
ingenuity has devised better means to meet the dangers of natural forces.&nbsp;
But it is always the same problem.&nbsp; The youngsters who were growing
up at sea at the end of my service are commanding ships now.&nbsp; At
least I have heard of some of them who do.&nbsp; And whatever the shape
and power of their ships the character of the duty remains the same.&nbsp;
A mine or a torpedo that strikes your ship is not so very different
from a sharp, uncharted rock tearing her life out of her in another
way.&nbsp; At a greater cost of vital energy, under the well-nigh intolerable
stress of vigilance and resolution, they are doing steadily the work
of their professional forefathers in the midst of multiplied dangers.&nbsp;
They go to and fro across the oceans on their everlasting task: the
same men, the same stout hearts, the same fidelity to an exacting tradition
created by simple toilers who in their time knew how to live and die
at sea.</p>
<p>Allowed to share in this work and in this tradition for something
like twenty years, I am bold enough to think that perhaps I am not altogether
unworthy to speak of it.&nbsp; It was the sphere not only of my activity
but, I may safely say, also of my affections; but after such a close
connection it is very difficult to avoid bringing in one&rsquo;s own
personality.&nbsp; Without looking at all at the aspects of the Labour
problem, I can safely affirm that I have never, never seen British seamen
refuse any risk, any exertion, any effort of spirit or body up to the
extremest demands of their calling.&nbsp; Years ago&mdash;it seems ages
ago&mdash;I have seen the crew of a British ship fight the fire in the
cargo for a whole sleepless week and then, with her decks blown up,
I have seen them still continue the fight to save the floating shell.&nbsp;
And at last I have seen them refuse to be taken off by a vessel standing
by, and this only in order &ldquo;to see the last of our ship,&rdquo;
at the word, at the simple word, of a man who commanded them, a worthy
soul indeed, but of no heroic aspect.&nbsp; I have seen that.&nbsp;
I have shared their days in small boats.&nbsp; Hard days.&nbsp; Ages
ago.&nbsp; And now let me mention a story of to-day.</p>
<p>I will try to relate it here mainly in the words of the chief engineer
of a certain steamship which, after bunkering, left Lerwick, bound for
Iceland.&nbsp; The weather was cold, the sea pretty rough, with a stiff
head wind.&nbsp; All went well till next day, about 1.30 p.m., then
the captain sighted a suspicious object far away to starboard.&nbsp;
Speed was increased at once to close in with the Faroes and good lookouts
were set fore and aft.&nbsp; Nothing further was seen of the suspicious
object, but about half-past three without any warning the ship was struck
amidships by a torpedo which exploded in the bunkers.&nbsp; None of
the crew was injured by the explosion, and all hands, without exception,
behaved admirably.</p>
<p>The chief officer with his watch managed to lower the No. 3 boat.&nbsp;
Two other boats had been shattered by the explosion, and though another
lifeboat was cleared and ready, there was no time to lower it, and &ldquo;some
of us jumped while others were washed overboard.&nbsp; Meantime the
captain had been busy handing lifebelts to the men and cheering them
up with words and smiles, with no thought of his own safety.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The ship went down in less than four minutes.&nbsp; The captain was
the last man on board, going down with her, and was sucked under.&nbsp;
On coming up he was caught under an upturned boat to which five hands
were clinging.&nbsp; &ldquo;One lifeboat,&rdquo; says the chief engineer,
&ldquo;which was floating empty in the distance was cleverly manoeuvred
to our assistance by the steward, who swam off to her pluckily.&nbsp;
Our next endeavour was to release the captain, who was entangled under
the boat.&nbsp; As it was impossible to right her, we set-to to split
her side open with the boat hook, because by awful bad luck the head
of the axe we had flew off at the first blow and was lost.&nbsp; The
rescue took thirty minutes, and the extricated captain was in a pitiable
condition, being badly bruised and having swallowed a lot of salt water.&nbsp;
He was unconscious.&nbsp; While at that work the submarine came to the
surface quite close and made a complete circle round us, the seven men
that we counted on the conning tower laughing at our efforts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were eighteen of us saved.&nbsp; I deeply regret the
loss of the chief officer, a fine fellow and a kind shipmate showing
splendid promise.&nbsp; The other men lost&mdash;one A.B., one greaser,
and two firemen&mdash;were quiet, conscientious, good fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With no restoratives in the boat, they endeavoured to bring the captain
round by means of massage.&nbsp; Meantime the oars were got out in order
to reach the Faroes, which were about thirty miles dead to windward,
but after about nine hours&rsquo; hard work they had to desist, and,
putting out a sea-anchor, they took shelter under the canvas boat-cover
from the cold wind and torrential rain.&nbsp; Says the narrator: &ldquo;We
were all very wet and miserable, and decided to have two biscuits all
round.&nbsp; The effects of this and being under the shelter of the
canvas warmed us up and made us feel pretty well contented.&nbsp; At
about sunrise the captain showed signs of recovery, and by the time
the sun was up he was looking a lot better, much to our relief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After being informed of what had been done the revived captain &ldquo;dropped
a bombshell in our midst,&rdquo; by proposing to make for the Shetlands,
which were <i>only</i> one hundred and fifty miles off.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
wind is in our favour,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I promise to take
you there.&nbsp; Are you all willing?&rdquo;&nbsp; This&mdash;comments
the chief engineer&mdash;&ldquo;from a man who but a few hours previously
had been hauled back from the grave!&rdquo;&nbsp; The captain&rsquo;s
confident manner inspired the men, and they all agreed.&nbsp; Under
the best possible conditions a boat-run of one hundred and fifty miles
in the North Atlantic and in winter weather would have been a feat of
no mean merit, but in the circumstances it required uncommon nerve and
skill to carry out such a promise.&nbsp; With an oar for a mast and
the boat-cover cut down for a sail they started on their dangerous journey,
with the boat compass and the stars for their guide.&nbsp; The captain&rsquo;s
undaunted serenity buoyed them all up against despondency.&nbsp; He
told them what point he was making for.&nbsp; It was Ronas Hill, &ldquo;and
we struck it as straight as a die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chief engineer commends also the ship steward for the manner
in which he made the little food they had last, the cheery spirit he
manifested, and the great help he was to the captain by keeping the
men in good humour.&nbsp; That trusty man had &ldquo;his hands cruelly
chafed with the rowing, but it never damped his spirits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They made Ronas Hill (as straight as a die), and the chief engineer
cannot express their feelings of gratitude and relief when they set
their feet on the shore.&nbsp; He praises the unbounded kindness of
the people in Hillswick.&nbsp; &ldquo;It seemed to us all like Paradise
regained,&rdquo; he says, concluding his letter with the words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there was our captain, just his usual self, as if nothing
had happened, as if bringing the boat that hazardous journey and being
the means of saving eighteen souls was to him an everyday occurrence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such is the chief engineer&rsquo;s testimony to the continuity of
the old tradition of the sea, which made by the work of men has in its
turn created for them their simple ideal of conduct.</p>
<h3>CONFIDENCE&mdash;1919</h3>
<h4>I.</h4>
<p>The seamen hold up the Edifice.&nbsp; They have been holding it up
in the past and they will hold it up in the future, whatever this future
may contain of logical development, of unforeseen new shapes, of great
promises and of dangers still unknown.</p>
<p>It is not an unpardonable stretching of the truth to say that the
British Empire rests on transportation.&nbsp; I am speaking now naturally
of the sea, as a man who has lived on it for many years, at a time,
too, when on sighting a vessel on the horizon of any of the great oceans
it was perfectly safe to bet any reasonable odds on her being a British
ship&mdash;with the certitude of making a pretty good thing of it at
the end of the voyage.</p>
<p>I have tried to convey here in popular terms the strong impression
remembered from my young days.&nbsp; The Red Ensign prevailed on the
high seas to such an extent that one always experienced a slight shock
on seeing some other combination of colours blow out at the peak or
flag-pole of any chance encounter in deep water.&nbsp; In the long run
the persistence of the visual fact forced upon the mind a half-unconscious
sense of its inner significance.&nbsp; We have all heard of the well-known
view that trade follows the flag.&nbsp; And that is not always true.&nbsp;
There is also this truth that the flag, in normal conditions, represents
commerce to the eye and understanding of the average man.&nbsp; This
is a truth, but it is not the whole truth.&nbsp; In its numbers and
in its unfailing ubiquity, the British Red Ensign, under which naval
actions too have been fought, adventures entered upon and sacrifices
offered, represented in fact something more than the prestige of a great
trade.</p>
<p>The flutter of that piece of red bunting showered sentiment on the
nations of the earth.&nbsp; I will not venture to say that in every
case that sentiment was of a friendly nature.&nbsp; Of hatred, half
concealed or concealed not at all, this is not the place to speak; and
indeed the little I have seen of it about the world was tainted with
stupidity and seemed to confess in its very violence the extreme poorness
of its case.&nbsp; But generally it was more in the nature of envious
wonder qualified by a half-concealed admiration.</p>
<p>That flag, which but for the Union Jack in the corner might have
been adopted by the most radical of revolutions, affirmed in its numbers
the stability of purpose, the continuity of effort and the greatness
of Britain&rsquo;s opportunity pursued steadily in the order and peace
of the world: that world which for twenty-five years or so after 1870
may be said to have been living in holy calm and hushed silence with
only now and then a slight clink of metal, as if in some distant part
of mankind&rsquo;s habitation some restless body had stumbled over a
heap of old armour.</p>
<h4>II.</h4>
<p>We who have learned by now what a world-war is like may be excused
for considering the disturbances of that period as insignificant brawls,
mere hole-and-corner scuffles.&nbsp; In the world, which memory depicts
as so wonderfully tranquil all over, it was the sea yet that was the
safest place.&nbsp; And the Red Ensign, commercial, industrial, historic,
pervaded the sea!&nbsp; Assertive only by its numbers, highly significant,
and, under its character of a trade&mdash;emblem, nationally expressive,
it was symbolic of old and new ideas, of conservatism and progress,
of routine and enterprise, of drudgery and adventure&mdash;and of a
certain easy-going optimism that would have appeared the Father of Sloth
itself if it had not been so stubbornly, so everlastingly active.</p>
<p>The unimaginative, hard-working men, great and small, who served
this flag afloat and ashore, nursed dumbly a mysterious sense of its
greatness.&nbsp; It sheltered magnificently their vagabond labours under
the sleepless eye of the sun.&nbsp; It held up the Edifice.&nbsp; But
it crowned it too.&nbsp; This is not the extravagance of a mixed metaphor.&nbsp;
It is the sober expression of a not very complex truth.&nbsp; Within
that double function the national life that flag represented so well
went on in safety, assured of its daily crust of bread for which we
all pray and without which we would have to give up faith, hope and
charity, the intellectual conquests of our minds and the sanctified
strength of our labouring arms.&nbsp; I may permit myself to speak of
it in these terms because as a matter of fact it was on that very symbol
that I had founded my life and (as I have said elsewhere in a moment
of outspoken gratitude) had known for many years no other roof above
my head.</p>
<p>In those days that symbol was not particularly regarded.&nbsp; Superficially
and definitely it represented but one of the forms of national activity
rather remote from the close-knit organisations of other industries,
a kind of toil not immediately under the public eye.&nbsp; It was of
its Navy that the nation, looking out of the windows of its world-wide
Edifice, was proudly aware.&nbsp; And that was but fair.&nbsp; The Navy
is the armed man at the gate.&nbsp; An existence depending upon the
sea must be guarded with a jealous, sleepless vigilance, for the sea
is but a fickle friend.</p>
<p>It had provoked conflicts, encouraged ambitions, and had lured some
nations to destruction&mdash;as we know.&nbsp; He&mdash;man or people&mdash;who,
boasting of long years of familiarity with the sea, neglects the strength
and cunning of his right hand is a fool.&nbsp; The pride and trust of
the nation in its Navy so strangely mingled with moments of neglect,
caused by a particularly thick-headed idealism, is perfectly justified.&nbsp;
It is also very proper: for it is good for a body of men conscious of
a great responsibility to feel themselves recognised, if only in that
fallible, imperfect and often irritating way in which recognition is
sometimes offered to the deserving.</p>
<p>But the Merchant Service had never to suffer from that sort of irritation.&nbsp;
No recognition was thrust on it offensively, and, truth to say, it did
not seem to concern itself unduly with the claims of its own obscure
merit.&nbsp; It had no consciousness.&nbsp; It had no words.&nbsp; It
had no time.&nbsp; To these busy men their work was but the ordinary
labour of earning a living; their duties in their ever-recurring round
had, like the sun itself, the commonness of daily things; their individual
fidelity was not so much united as merely co-ordinated by an aim that
shone with no spiritual lustre.&nbsp; They were everyday men.&nbsp;
They were that, eminently.&nbsp; When the great opportunity came to
them to link arms in response to a supreme call they received it with
characteristic simplicity, incorporating self-sacrifice into the texture
of their common task, and, as far as emotion went, framing the horror
of mankind&rsquo;s catastrophic time within the rigid rules of their
professional conscience.&nbsp; And who can say that they could have
done better than this?</p>
<p>Such was their past both remote and near.&nbsp; It has been stubbornly
consistent, and as this consistency was based upon the character of
men fashioned by a very old tradition, there is no doubt that it will
endure.&nbsp; Such changes as came into the sea life have been for the
main part mechanical and affecting only the material conditions of that
inbred consistency.&nbsp; That men don&rsquo;t change is a profound
truth.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t change because it is not necessary for
them to change even if they could accomplish that miracle.&nbsp; It
is enough for them to be infinitely adaptable&mdash;as the last four
years have abundantly proved.</p>
<h4>III.</h4>
<p>Thus one may await the future without undue excitement and with unshaken
confidence.&nbsp; Whether the hues of sunrise are angry or benign, gorgeous
or sinister, we shall always have the same sky over our heads.&nbsp;
Yet by a kindly dispensation of Providence the human faculty of astonishment
will never lack food.&nbsp; What could be more surprising for instance,
than the calm invitation to Great Britain to discard the force and protection
of its Navy?&nbsp; It has been suggested, it has been proposed&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t know whether it has been pressed.&nbsp; Probably not much.&nbsp;
For if the excursions of audacious folly have no bounds that human eye
can see, reason has the habit of never straying very far away from its
throne.</p>
<p>It is not the first time in history that excited voices have been
heard urging the warrior still panting from the fray to fling his tried
weapons on the altar of peace, for they would be needed no more!&nbsp;
And such voices have been, in undying hope or extreme weariness, listened
to sometimes.&nbsp; But not for long.&nbsp; After all every sort of
shouting is a transitory thing.&nbsp; It is the grim silence of facts
that remains.</p>
<p>The British Merchant Service has been challenged in its supremacy
before.&nbsp; It will be challenged again.&nbsp; It may be even asked
menacingly in the name of some humanitarian doctrine or some empty ideal
to step down voluntarily from that place which it has managed to keep
for so many years.&nbsp; But I imagine that it will take more than words
of brotherly love or brotherly anger (which, as is well known, is the
worst kind of anger) to drive British seamen, armed or unarmed, from
the seas.&nbsp; Firm in this indestructible if not easily explained
conviction, I can allow myself to think placidly of that long, long
future which I shall not see.</p>
<p>My confidence rests on the hearts of men who do not change, though
they may forget many things for a time and even forget to be themselves
in a moment of false enthusiasm.&nbsp; But of that I am not afraid.&nbsp;
It will not be for long.&nbsp; I know the men.&nbsp; Through the kindness
of the Admiralty (which, let me confess here in a white sheet, I repaid
by the basest ingratitude) I was permitted during the war to renew my
contact with the British seamen of the merchant service.&nbsp; It is
to their generosity in recognising me under the shore rust of twenty-five
years as one of themselves that I owe one of the deepest emotions of
my life.&nbsp; Never for a moment did I feel among them like an idle,
wandering ghost from a distant past.&nbsp; They talked to me seriously,
openly, and with professional precision, of facts, of events, of implements,
I had never heard of in my time; but the hands I grasped were like the
hands of the generation which had trained my youth and is now no more.&nbsp;
I recognised the character of their glances, the accent of their voices.&nbsp;
Their moving tales of modern instances were presented to me with that
peculiar turn of mind flavoured by the inherited humour and sagacity
of the sea.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what the seaman of the future will
be like.&nbsp; He may have to live all his days with a telephone tied
up to his head and bristle all over with scientific antenn&aelig; like
a figure in a fantastic tale.&nbsp; But he will always be the man revealed
to us lately, immutable in his slight variations like the closed path
of this planet of ours on which he must find his exact position once,
at the very least, in every twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>The greatest desideratum of a sailor&rsquo;s life is to be &ldquo;certain
of his position.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is a source of great worry at times,
but I don&rsquo;t think that it need be so at this time.&nbsp; Yet even
the best position has its dangers on account of the fickleness of the
elements.&nbsp; But I think that, left untrammelled to the individual
effort of its creators and to the collective spirit of its servants,
the British Merchant Service will manage to maintain its position on
this restless and watery globe.</p>
<h3>FLIGHT&mdash;1917</h3>
<p>To begin at the end, I will say that the &ldquo;landing&rdquo; surprised
me by a slight and very characteristically &ldquo;dead&rdquo; sort of
shock.</p>
<p>I may fairly call myself an amphibious creature.&nbsp; A good half
of my active existence has been passed in familiar contact with salt
water, and I was aware, theoretically, that water is not an elastic
body: but it was only then that I acquired the absolute conviction of
the fact.&nbsp; I remember distinctly the thought flashing through my
head: &ldquo;By Jove! it isn&rsquo;t elastic!&rdquo;&nbsp; Such is the
illuminating force of a particular experience.</p>
<p>This landing (on the water of the North Sea) was effected in a Short
biplane after one hour and twenty minutes in the air.&nbsp; I reckon
every minute like a miser counting his hoard, for, if what I&rsquo;ve
got is mine, I am not likely now to increase the tale.&nbsp; That feeling
is the effect of age.&nbsp; It strikes me as I write that, when next
time I leave the surface of this globe, it won&rsquo;t be to soar bodily
above it in the air.&nbsp; Quite the contrary.&nbsp; And I am not thinking
of a submarine either. . . .</p>
<p>But let us drop this dismal strain and go back logically to the beginning.&nbsp;
I must confess that I started on that flight in a state&mdash;I won&rsquo;t
say of fury, but of a most intense irritation.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t remember
ever feeling so annoyed in my life.</p>
<p>It came about in this way.&nbsp; Two or three days before, I had
been invited to lunch at an R.N.A.S. station, and was made to feel very
much at home by the nicest lot of quietly interesting young men it had
ever been my good fortune to meet.&nbsp; Then I was taken into the sheds.&nbsp;
I walked respectfully round and round a lot of machines of all kinds,
and the more I looked at them the more I felt somehow that for all the
effect they produced on me they might have been so many land-vehicles
of an eccentric design.&nbsp; So I said to Commander O., who very kindly
was conducting me: &ldquo;This is all very fine, but to realise what
one is looking at, one must have been up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said at once: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a flight to-morrow if
you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I postulated that it should be none of those &ldquo;ten minutes in
the air&rdquo; affairs.&nbsp; I wanted a real business flight.&nbsp;
Commander O. assured me that I would get &ldquo;awfully bored,&rdquo;
but I declared that I was willing to take that risk.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very
well,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Eleven o&rsquo;clock to-morrow.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t be late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am sorry to say I was about two minutes late, which was enough,
however, for Commander O. to greet me with a shout from a great distance:
&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; You are coming, then!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I am coming,&rdquo; I yelled indignantly.</p>
<p>He hurried up to me.&nbsp; &ldquo;All right.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
your machine, and here&rsquo;s your pilot.&nbsp; Come along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A lot of officers closed round me, rushed me into a hut: two of them
began to button me into the coat, two more were ramming a cap on my
head, others stood around with goggles, with binoculars. . . I couldn&rsquo;t
understand the necessity of such haste.&nbsp; We weren&rsquo;t going
to chase Fritz.&nbsp; There was no sign of Fritz anywhere in the blue.&nbsp;
Those dear boys did not seem to notice my age&mdash;fifty-eight, if
a day&mdash;nor my infirmities&mdash;a gouty subject for years.&nbsp;
This disregard was very flattering, and I tried to live up to it, but
the pace seemed to me terrific.&nbsp; They galloped me across a vast
expanse of open ground to the water&rsquo;s edge.</p>
<p>The machine on its carriage seemed as big as a cottage, and much
more imposing.&nbsp; My young pilot went up like a bird.&nbsp; There
was an idle, able-bodied ladder loafing against a shed within fifteen
feet of me, but as nobody seemed to notice it, I recommended myself
mentally to Heaven and started climbing after the pilot.&nbsp; The close
view of the real fragility of that rigid structure startled me considerably,
while Commander O. discomposed me still more by shouting repeatedly:
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put your foot there!&rdquo;&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t
know where to put my foot.&nbsp; There was a slight crack; I heard some
swear-words below me, and then with a supreme effort I rolled in and
dropped into a basket-chair, absolutely winded.&nbsp; A small crowd
of mechanics and officers were looking up at me from the ground, and
while I gasped visibly I thought to myself that they would be sure to
put it down to sheer nervousness.&nbsp; But I hadn&rsquo;t breath enough
in my body to stick my head out and shout down to them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, it isn&rsquo;t that at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Generally I try not to think of my age and infirmities.&nbsp; They
are not a cheerful subject.&nbsp; But I was never so angry and disgusted
with them as during that minute or so before the machine took the water.&nbsp;
As to my feelings in the air, those who will read these lines will know
their own, which are so much nearer the mind and the heart than any
writings of an unprofessional can be.&nbsp; At first all my faculties
were absorbed and as if neutralised by the sheer novelty of the situation.&nbsp;
The first to emerge was the sense of security so much more perfect than
in any small boat I&rsquo;ve ever been in; the, as it were, material,
stillness, and immobility (though it was a bumpy day).&nbsp; I very
soon ceased to hear the roar of the wind and engines&mdash;unless, indeed,
some cylinders missed, when I became acutely aware of that.&nbsp; Within
the rigid spread of the powerful planes, so strangely motionless I had
sometimes the illusion of sitting as if by enchantment in a block of
suspended marble.&nbsp; Even while looking over at the aeroplane&rsquo;s
shadow running prettily over land and sea, I had the impression of extreme
slowness.&nbsp; I imagine that had she suddenly nose-dived out of control,
I would have gone to the final smash without a single additional heartbeat.&nbsp;
I am sure I would not have known.&nbsp; It is doubtless otherwise with
the man in control.</p>
<p>But there was no dive, and I returned to earth (after an hour and
twenty minutes) without having felt &ldquo;bored&rdquo; for a single
second.&nbsp; I descended (by the ladder) thinking that I would never
go flying again.&nbsp; No, never any more&mdash;lest its mysterious
fascination, whose invisible wing had brushed my heart up there, should
change to unavailing regret in a man too old for its glory.</p>
<h3>SOME REFLECTIONS ON THE LOSS OF THE TITANIC&mdash;1912</h3>
<p>It is with a certain bitterness that one must admit to oneself that
the late <i>S.S. Titanic</i> had a &ldquo;good press.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
is perhaps because I have no great practice of daily newspapers (I have
never seen so many of them together lying about my room) that the white
spaces and the big lettering of the headlines have an incongruously
festive air to my eyes, a disagreeable effect of a feverish exploitation
of a sensational God-send.&nbsp; And if ever a loss at sea fell under
the definition, in the terms of a bill of lading, of Act of God, this
one does, in its magnitude, suddenness and severity; and in the chastening
influence it should have on the self-confidence of mankind.</p>
<p>I say this with all the seriousness the occasion demands, though
I have neither the competence nor the wish to take a theological view
of this great misfortune, sending so many souls to their last account.&nbsp;
It is but a natural <i>reflection</i>.&nbsp; Another one flowing also
from the phraseology of bills of lading (a bill of lading is a shipping
document limiting in certain of its clauses the liability of the carrier)
is that the &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Enemies&rdquo; of a more or less overt
sort are not altogether sorry that this fatal mishap should strike the
prestige of the greatest Merchant Service of the world.&nbsp; I believe
that not a thousand miles from these shores certain public prints have
betrayed in gothic letters their satisfaction&mdash;to speak plainly&mdash;by
rather ill-natured comments.</p>
<p>In what light one is to look at the action of the American Senate
is more difficult to say.&nbsp; From a certain point of view the sight
of the august senators of a great Power rushing to New York and beginning
to bully and badger the luckless &ldquo;Yamsi&rdquo;&mdash;on the very
quay-side so to speak&mdash;seems to furnish the Shakespearian touch
of the comic to the real tragedy of the fatuous drowning of all these
people who to the last moment put their trust in mere bigness, in the
reckless affirmations of commercial men and mere technicians and in
the irresponsible paragraphs of the newspapers booming these ships!&nbsp;
Yes, a grim touch of comedy.&nbsp; One asks oneself what these men are
after, with this very provincial display of authority.&nbsp; I beg my
friends in the United States pardon for calling these zealous senators
men.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t wish to be disrespectful.&nbsp; They may be
of the stature of demi-gods for all I know, but at that great distance
from the shores of effete Europe and in the presence of so many guileless
dead, their size seems diminished from this side.&nbsp; What are they
after?&nbsp; What is there for them to find out?&nbsp; We know what
had happened.&nbsp; The ship scraped her side against a piece of ice,
and sank after floating for two hours and a half, taking a lot of people
down with her.&nbsp; What more can they find out from the unfair badgering
of the unhappy &ldquo;Yamsi,&rdquo; or the ruffianly abuse of the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yamsi,&rdquo; I should explain, is a mere code address, and
I use it here symbolically.&nbsp; I have seen commerce pretty close.&nbsp;
I know what it is worth, and I have no particular regard for commercial
magnates, but one must protest against these Bumble-like proceedings.&nbsp;
Is it indignation at the loss of so many lives which is at work here?&nbsp;
Well, the American railroads kill very many people during one single
year, I dare say.&nbsp; Then why don&rsquo;t these dignitaries come
down on the presidents of their own railroads, of which one can&rsquo;t
say whether they are mere means of transportation or a sort of gambling
game for the use of American plutocrats.&nbsp; Is it only an ardent
and, upon the whole, praiseworthy desire for information?&nbsp; But
the reports of the inquiry tell us that the august senators, though
raising a lot of questions testifying to the complete innocence and
even blankness of their minds, are unable to understand what the second
officer is saying to them.&nbsp; We are so informed by the press from
the other side.&nbsp; Even such a simple expression as that one of the
look-out men was stationed in the &ldquo;eyes of the ship&rdquo; was
too much for the senators of the land of graphic expression.&nbsp; What
it must have been in the more recondite matters I won&rsquo;t even try
to think, because I have no mind for smiles just now.&nbsp; They were
greatly exercised about the sound of explosions heard when half the
ship was under water already.&nbsp; Was there one?&nbsp; Were there
two?&nbsp; They seemed to be smelling a rat there!&nbsp; Has not some
charitable soul told them (what even schoolboys who read sea stories
know) that when a ship sinks from a leak like this, a deck or two is
always blown up; and that when a steamship goes down by the head, the
boilers may, and often do break adrift with a sound which resembles
the sound of an explosion?&nbsp; And they may, indeed, explode, for
all I know.&nbsp; In the only case I have seen of a steamship sinking
there was such a sound, but I didn&rsquo;t dive down after her to investigate.&nbsp;
She was not of 45,000 tons and declared unsinkable, but the sight was
impressive enough.&nbsp; I shall never forget the muffled, mysterious
detonation, the sudden agitation of the sea round the slowly raised
stern, and to this day I have in my eye the propeller, seen perfectly
still in its frame against a clear evening sky.</p>
<p>But perhaps the second officer has explained to them by this time
this and a few other little facts.&nbsp; Though why an officer of the
British merchant service should answer the questions of any king, emperor,
autocrat, or senator of any foreign power (as to an event in which a
British ship alone was concerned, and which did not even take place
in the territorial waters of that power) passes my understanding.&nbsp;
The only authority he is bound to answer is the Board of Trade.&nbsp;
But with what face the Board of Trade, which, having made the regulations
for 10,000 ton ships, put its dear old bald head under its wing for
ten years, took it out only to shelve an important report, and with
a dreary murmur, &ldquo;Unsinkable,&rdquo; put it back again, in the
hope of not being disturbed for another ten years, with what face it
will be putting questions to that man who has done his duty, as to the
facts of this disaster and as to his professional conduct in it&mdash;well,
I don&rsquo;t know!&nbsp; I have the greatest respect for our established
authorities.&nbsp; I am a disciplined man, and I have a natural indulgence
for the weaknesses of human institutions; but I will own that at times
I have regretted their&mdash;how shall I say it?&mdash;their imponderability.&nbsp;
A Board of Trade&mdash;what is it?&nbsp; A Board of . . . I believe
the Speaker of the Irish Parliament is one of the members of it.&nbsp;
A ghost.&nbsp; Less than that; as yet a mere memory.&nbsp; An office
with adequate and no doubt comfortable furniture and a lot of perfectly
irresponsible gentlemen who exist packed in its equable atmosphere softly,
as if in a lot of cotton-wool, and with no care in the world; for there
can be no care without personal responsibility&mdash;such, for instance,
as the seamen have&mdash;those seamen from whose mouths this irresponsible
institution can take away the bread&mdash;as a disciplinary measure.&nbsp;
Yes&mdash;it&rsquo;s all that.&nbsp; And what more?&nbsp; The name of
a politician&mdash;a party man!&nbsp; Less than nothing; a mere void
without as much as a shadow of responsibility cast into it from that
light in which move the masses of men who work, who deal in things and
face the realities&mdash;not the words&mdash;of this life.</p>
<p>Years ago I remember overhearing two genuine shellbacks of the old
type commenting on a ship&rsquo;s officer, who, if not exactly incompetent,
did not commend himself to their severe judgment of accomplished sailor-men.&nbsp;
Said one, resuming and concluding the discussion in a funnily judicial
tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Board of Trade must have been drunk when they gave him
his certificate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I confess that this notion of the Board of Trade as an entity having
a brain which could be overcome by the fumes of strong liquor charmed
me exceedingly.&nbsp; For then it would have been unlike the limited
companies of which some exasperated wit has once said that they had
no souls to be saved and no bodies to be kicked, and thus were free
in this world and the next from all the effective sanctions of conscientious
conduct.&nbsp; But, unfortunately, the picturesque pronouncement overheard
by me was only a characteristic sally of an annoyed sailor.&nbsp; The
Board of Trade is composed of bloodless departments.&nbsp; It has no
limbs and no physiognomy, or else at the forthcoming inquiry it might
have paid to the victims of the <i>Titanic</i> disaster the small tribute
of a blush.&nbsp; I ask myself whether the Marine Department of the
Board of Trade did really believe, when they decided to shelve the report
on equipment for a time, that a ship of 45,000 tons, that <i>any</i>
ship, could be made practically indestructible by means of water-tight
bulkheads?&nbsp; It seems incredible to anybody who had ever reflected
upon the properties of material, such as wood or steel.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t,
let builders say what they like, make a ship of such dimensions as strong
proportionately as a much smaller one.&nbsp; The shocks our old whalers
had to stand amongst the heavy floes in Baffin&rsquo;s Bay were perfectly
staggering, notwithstanding the most skilful handling, and yet they
lasted for years.&nbsp; The <i>Titanic</i>, if one may believe the last
reports, has only scraped against a piece of ice which, I suspect, was
not an enormously bulky and comparatively easily seen berg, but the
low edge of a floe&mdash;and sank.&nbsp; Leisurely enough, God knows&mdash;and
here the advantage of bulkheads comes in&mdash;for time is a great friend,
a good helper&mdash;though in this lamentable case these bulkheads served
only to prolong the agony of the passengers who could not be saved.&nbsp;
But she sank, causing, apart from the sorrow and the pity of the loss
of so many lives, a sort of surprised consternation that such a thing
should have happened at all.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; You build a 45,000 tons
hotel of thin steel plates to secure the patronage of, say, a couple
of thousand rich people (for if it had been for the emigrant trade alone,
there would have been no such exaggeration of mere size), you decorate
it in the style of the Pharaohs or in the Louis Quinze style&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t know which&mdash;and to please the aforesaid fatuous handful
of individuals, who have more money than they know what to do with,
and to the applause of two continents, you launch that mass with two
thousand people on board at twenty-one knots across the sea&mdash;a
perfect exhibition of the modern blind trust in mere material and appliances.&nbsp;
And then this happens.&nbsp; General uproar.&nbsp; The blind trust in
material and appliances has received a terrible shock.&nbsp; I will
say nothing of the credulity which accepts any statement which specialists,
technicians and office-people are pleased to make, whether for purposes
of gain or glory.&nbsp; You stand there astonished and hurt in your
profoundest sensibilities.&nbsp; But what else under the circumstances
could you expect?</p>
<p>For my part I could much sooner believe in an unsinkable ship of
3,000 tons than in one of 40,000 tons.&nbsp; It is one of those things
that stand to reason.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t increase the thickness of
scantling and plates indefinitely.&nbsp; And the mere weight of this
bigness is an added disadvantage.&nbsp; In reading the reports, the
first reflection which occurs to one is that, if that luckless ship
had been a couple of hundred feet shorter, she would have probably gone
clear of the danger.&nbsp; But then, perhaps, she could not have had
a swimming bath and a French caf&eacute;.&nbsp; That, of course, is
a serious consideration.&nbsp; I am well aware that those responsible
for her short and fatal existence ask us in desolate accents to believe
that if she had hit end on she would have survived.&nbsp; Which, by
a sort of coy implication, seems to mean that it was all the fault of
the officer of the watch (he is dead now) for trying to avoid the obstacle.&nbsp;
We shall have presently, in deference to commercial and industrial interests,
a new kind of seamanship.&nbsp; A very new and &ldquo;progressive&rdquo;
kind.&nbsp; If you see anything in the way, by no means try to avoid
it; smash at it full tilt.&nbsp; And then&mdash;and then only you shall
see the triumph of material, of clever contrivances, of the whole box
of engineering tricks in fact, and cover with glory a commercial concern
of the most unmitigated sort, a great Trust, and a great ship-building
yard, justly famed for the super-excellence of its material and workmanship.&nbsp;
Unsinkable!&nbsp; See?&nbsp; I told you she was unsinkable, if only
handled in accordance with the new seamanship.&nbsp; Everything&rsquo;s
in that.&nbsp; And, doubtless, the Board of Trade, if properly approached,
would consent to give the needed instructions to its examiners of Masters
and Mates.&nbsp; Behold the examination-room of the future.&nbsp; Enter
to the grizzled examiner a young man of modest aspect: &ldquo;Are you
well up in modern seamanship?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope so, sir.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;H&rsquo;m, let&rsquo;s see.&nbsp; You are at night on the bridge
in charge of a 150,000 tons ship, with a motor track, organ-loft, etc.,
etc., with a full cargo of passengers, a full crew of 1,500 caf&eacute;
waiters, two sailors and a boy, three collapsible boats as per Board
of Trade regulations, and going at your three-quarter speed of, say,
about forty knots.&nbsp; You perceive suddenly right ahead, and close
to, something that looks like a large ice-floe.&nbsp; What would you
do?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Put the helm amidships.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Very
well.&nbsp; Why?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;In order to hit end on.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;On what grounds should you endeavour to hit end on?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Because we are taught by our builders and masters that the heavier
the smash, the smaller the damage, and because the requirements of material
should be attended to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so on and so on.&nbsp; The new seamanship: when in doubt try
to ram fairly&mdash;whatever&rsquo;s before you.&nbsp; Very simple.&nbsp;
If only the <i>Titanic</i> had rammed that piece of ice (which was not
a monstrous berg) fairly, every puffing paragraph would have been vindicated
in the eyes of the credulous public which pays.&nbsp; But would it have
been?&nbsp; Well, I doubt it.&nbsp; I am well aware that in the eighties
the steamship Arizona, one of the &ldquo;greyhounds of the ocean&rdquo;
in the jargon of that day, did run bows on against a very unmistakable
iceberg, and managed to get into port on her collision bulkhead.&nbsp;
But the <i>Arizona</i> was not, if I remember rightly, 5,000 tons register,
let alone 45,000, and she was not going at twenty knots per hour.&nbsp;
I can&rsquo;t be perfectly certain at this distance of time, but her
sea-speed could not have been more than fourteen at the outside.&nbsp;
Both these facts made for safety.&nbsp; And, even if she had been engined
to go twenty knots, there would not have been behind that speed the
enormous mass, so difficult to check in its impetus, the terrific weight
of which is bound to do damage to itself or others at the slightest
contact.</p>
<p>I assure you it is not for the vain pleasure of talking about my
own poor experiences, but only to illustrate my point, that I will relate
here a very unsensational little incident I witnessed now rather more
than twenty years ago in Sydney, N.S.W.&nbsp; Ships were beginning then
to grow bigger year after year, though, of course, the present dimensions
were not even dreamt of.&nbsp; I was standing on the Circular Quay with
a Sydney pilot watching a big mail steamship of one of our best-known
companies being brought alongside.&nbsp; We admired her lines, her noble
appearance, and were impressed by her size as well, though her length,
I imagine, was hardly half that of the <i>Titanic</i>.</p>
<p>She came into the Cove (as that part of the harbour is called), of
course very slowly, and at some hundred feet or so short of the quay
she lost her way.&nbsp; That quay was then a wooden one, a fine structure
of mighty piles and stringers bearing a roadway&mdash;a thing of great
strength.&nbsp; The ship, as I have said before, stopped moving when
some hundred feet from it.&nbsp; Then her engines were rung on slow
ahead, and immediately rung off again.&nbsp; The propeller made just
about five turns, I should say.&nbsp; She began to move, stealing on,
so to speak, without a ripple; coming alongside with the utmost gentleness.&nbsp;
I went on looking her over, very much interested, but the man with me,
the pilot, muttered under his breath: &ldquo;Too much, too much.&rdquo;&nbsp;
His exercised judgment had warned him of what I did not even suspect.&nbsp;
But I believe that neither of us was exactly prepared for what happened.&nbsp;
There was a faint concussion of the ground under our feet, a groaning
of piles, a snapping of great iron bolts, and with a sound of ripping
and splintering, as when a tree is blown down by the wind, a great strong
piece of wood, a baulk of squared timber, was displaced several feet
as if by enchantment.&nbsp; I looked at my companion in amazement.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I could not have believed it,&rdquo; I declared.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo;
he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You would not have thought she would have cracked
an egg&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t have thought that.&nbsp; He shook his
head, and added: &ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; These great, big things, they want
some handling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some months afterwards I was back in Sydney.&nbsp; The same pilot
brought me in from sea.&nbsp; And I found the same steamship, or else
another as like her as two peas, lying at anchor not far from us.&nbsp;
The pilot told me she had arrived the day before, and that he was to
take her alongside to-morrow.&nbsp; I reminded him jocularly of the
damage to the quay.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we are not
allowed now to bring them in under their own steam.&nbsp; We are using
tugs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A very wise regulation.&nbsp; And this is my point&mdash;that size
is to a certain extent an element of weakness.&nbsp; The bigger the
ship, the more delicately she must be handled.&nbsp; Here is a contact
which, in the pilot&rsquo;s own words, you wouldn&rsquo;t think could
have cracked an egg; with the astonishing result of something like eighty
feet of good strong wooden quay shaken loose, iron bolts snapped, a
baulk of stout timber splintered.&nbsp; Now, suppose that quay had been
of granite (as surely it is now)&mdash;or, instead of the quay, if there
had been, say, a North Atlantic fog there, with a full-grown iceberg
in it awaiting the gentle contact of a ship groping its way along blindfold?&nbsp;
Something would have been hurt, but it would not have been the iceberg.</p>
<p>Apparently, there is a point in development when it ceases to be
a true progress&mdash;in trade, in games, in the marvellous handiwork
of men, and even in their demands and desires and aspirations of the
moral and mental kind.&nbsp; There is a point when progress, to remain
a real advance, must change slightly the direction of its line.&nbsp;
But this is a wide question.&nbsp; What I wanted to point out here is&mdash;that
the old <i>Arizona</i>, the marvel of her day, was proportionately stronger,
handier, better equipped, than this triumph of modern naval architecture,
the loss of which, in common parlance, will remain the sensation of
this year.&nbsp; The clatter of the presses has been worthy of the tonnage,
of the preliminary p&aelig;ans of triumph round that vanished hull,
of the reckless statements, and elaborate descriptions of its ornate
splendour.&nbsp; A great babble of news (and what sort of news too,
good heavens!) and eager comment has arisen around this catastrophe,
though it seems to me that a less strident note would have been more
becoming in the presence of so many victims left struggling on the sea,
of lives miserably thrown away for nothing, or worse than nothing: for
false standards of achievement, to satisfy a vulgar demand of a few
moneyed people for a banal hotel luxury&mdash;the only one they can
understand&mdash;and because the big ship pays, in one way or another:
in money or in advertising value.</p>
<p>It is in more ways than one a very ugly business, and a mere scrape
along the ship&rsquo;s side, so slight that, if reports are to be believed,
it did not interrupt a card party in the gorgeously fitted (but in chaste
style) smoking-room&mdash;or was it in the delightful French caf&eacute;?&mdash;is
enough to bring on the exposure.&nbsp; All the people on board existed
under a sense of false security.&nbsp; How false, it has been sufficiently
demonstrated.&nbsp; And the fact which seems undoubted, that some of
them actually were reluctant to enter the boats when told to do so,
shows the strength of that falsehood.&nbsp; Incidentally, it shows also
the sort of discipline on board these ships, the sort of hold kept on
the passengers in the face of the unforgiving sea.&nbsp; These people
seemed to imagine it an optional matter: whereas the order to leave
the ship should be an order of the sternest character, to be obeyed
unquestioningly and promptly by every one on board, with men to enforce
it at once, and to carry it out methodically and swiftly.&nbsp; And
it is no use to say it cannot be done, for it can.&nbsp; It has been
done.&nbsp; The only requisite is manageableness of the ship herself
and of the numbers she carries on board.&nbsp; That is the great thing
which makes for safety.&nbsp; A commander should be able to hold his
ship and everything on board of her in the hollow of his hand, as it
were.&nbsp; But with the modern foolish trust in material, and with
those floating hotels, this has become impossible.&nbsp; A man may do
his best, but he cannot succeed in a task which from greed, or more
likely from sheer stupidity, has been made too great for anybody&rsquo;s
strength.</p>
<p>The readers of <i>The English Review</i>, who cast a friendly eye
nearly six years ago on my Reminiscences, and know how much the merchant
service, ships and men, has been to me, will understand my indignation
that those men of whom (speaking in no sentimental phrase, but in the
very truth of feeling) I can&rsquo;t even now think otherwise than as
brothers, have been put by their commercial employers in the impossibility
to perform efficiently their plain duty; and this from motives which
I shall not enumerate here, but whose intrinsic unworthiness is plainly
revealed by the greatness, the miserable greatness, of that disaster.&nbsp;
Some of them have perished.&nbsp; To die for commerce is hard enough,
but to go under that sea we have been trained to combat, with a sense
of failure in the supreme duty of one&rsquo;s calling is indeed a bitter
fate.&nbsp; Thus they are gone, and the responsibility remains with
the living who will have no difficulty in replacing them by others,
just as good, at the same wages.&nbsp; It was their bitter fate.&nbsp;
But I, who can look at some arduous years when their duty was my duty
too, and their feelings were my feelings, can remember some of us who
once upon a time were more fortunate.</p>
<p>It is of them that I would talk a little, for my own comfort partly,
and also because I am sticking all the time to my subject to illustrate
my point, the point of manageableness which I have raised just now.&nbsp;
Since the memory of the lucky <i>Arizona</i> has been evoked by others
than myself, and made use of by me for my own purpose, let me call up
the ghost of another ship of that distant day whose less lucky destiny
inculcates another lesson making for my argument.&nbsp; The <i>Douro</i>,
a ship belonging to the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, was rather
less than one-tenth the measurement of the <i>Titanic</i>.&nbsp; Yet,
strange as it may appear to the ineffable hotel exquisites who form
the bulk of the first-class Cross-Atlantic Passengers, people of position
and wealth and refinement did not consider it an intolerable hardship
to travel in her, even all the way from South America; this being the
service she was engaged upon.&nbsp; Of her speed I know nothing, but
it must have been the average of the period, and the decorations of
her saloons were, I dare say, quite up to the mark; but I doubt if her
birth had been boastfully paragraphed all round the Press, because that
was not the fashion of the time.&nbsp; She was not a mass of material
gorgeously furnished and upholstered.&nbsp; She was a ship.&nbsp; And
she was not, in the apt words of an article by Commander C. Crutchley,
R.N.R., which I have just read, &ldquo;run by a sort of hotel syndicate
composed of the Chief Engineer, the Purser, and the Captain,&rdquo;
as these monstrous Atlantic ferries are.&nbsp; She was really commanded,
manned, and equipped as a ship meant to keep the sea: a ship first and
last in the fullest meaning of the term, as the fact I am going to relate
will show.</p>
<p>She was off the Spanish coast, homeward bound, and fairly full, just
like the <i>Titanic</i>; and further, the proportion of her crew to
her passengers, I remember quite well, was very much the same.&nbsp;
The exact number of souls on board I have forgotten.&nbsp; It might
have been nearly three hundred, certainly not more.&nbsp; The night
was moonlit, but hazy, the weather fine with a heavy swell running from
the westward, which means that she must have been rolling a great deal,
and in that respect the conditions for her were worse than in the case
of the <i>Titanic</i>.&nbsp; Some time either just before or just after
midnight, to the best of my recollection, she was run into amidships
and at right angles by a large steamer which after the blow backed out,
and, herself apparently damaged, remained motionless at some distance.</p>
<p>My recollection is that the <i>Douro</i> remained afloat after the
collision for fifteen minutes or thereabouts.&nbsp; It might have been
twenty, but certainly something under the half-hour.&nbsp; In that time
the boats were lowered, all the passengers put into them, and the lot
shoved off.&nbsp; There was no time to do anything more.&nbsp; All the
crew of the <i>Douro</i> went down with her, literally without a murmur.&nbsp;
When she went she plunged bodily down like a stone.&nbsp; The only members
of the ship&rsquo;s company who survived were the third officer, who
was from the first ordered to take charge of the boats, and the seamen
told off to man them, two in each.&nbsp; Nobody else was picked up.&nbsp;
A quartermaster, one of the saved in the way of duty, with whom I talked
a month or so afterwards, told me that they pulled up to the spot, but
could neither see a head nor hear the faintest cry.</p>
<p>But I have forgotten.&nbsp; A passenger was drowned.&nbsp; She was
a lady&rsquo;s maid who, frenzied with terror, refused to leave the
ship.&nbsp; One of the boats waited near by till the chief officer,
finding himself absolutely unable to tear the girl away from the rail
to which she dung with a frantic grasp, ordered the boat away out of
danger.&nbsp; My quartermaster told me that he spoke over to them in
his ordinary voice, and this was the last sound heard before the ship
sank.</p>
<p>The rest is silence.&nbsp; I daresay there was the usual official
inquiry, but who cared for it?&nbsp; That sort of thing speaks for itself
with no uncertain voice; though the papers, I remember, gave the event
no space to speak of: no large headlines&mdash;no headlines at all.&nbsp;
You see it was not the fashion at the time.&nbsp; A seaman-like piece
of work, of which one cherishes the old memory at this juncture more
than ever before.&nbsp; She was a ship commanded, manned, equipped&mdash;not
a sort of marine Ritz, proclaimed unsinkable and sent adrift with its
casual population upon the sea, without enough boats, without enough
seamen (but with a Parisian caf&eacute; and four hundred of poor devils
of waiters) to meet dangers which, let the engineers say what they like,
lurk always amongst the waves; sent with a blind trust in mere material,
light-heartedly, to a most miserable, most fatuous disaster.</p>
<p>And there are, too, many ugly developments about this tragedy.&nbsp;
The rush of the senatorial inquiry before the poor wretches escaped
from the jaws of death had time to draw breath, the vituperative abuse
of a man no more guilty than others in this matter, and the suspicion
of this aimless fuss being a political move to get home on the M.T.
Company, into which, in common parlance, the United States Government
has got its knife, I don&rsquo;t pretend to understand why, though with
the rest of the world I am aware of the fact.&nbsp; Perhaps there may
be an excellent and worthy reason for it; but I venture to suggest that
to take advantage of so many pitiful corpses, is not pretty.&nbsp; And
the exploiting of the mere sensation on the other side is not pretty
in its wealth of heartless inventions.&nbsp; Neither is the welter of
Marconi lies which has not been sent vibrating without some reason,
for which it would be nauseous to inquire too closely.&nbsp; And the
calumnious, baseless, gratuitous, circumstantial lie charging poor Captain
Smith with desertion of his post by means of suicide is the vilest and
most ugly thing of all in this outburst of journalistic enterprise,
without feeling, without honour, without decency.</p>
<p>But all this has its moral.&nbsp; And that other sinking which I
have related here and to the memory of which a seaman turns with relief
and thankfulness has its moral too.&nbsp; Yes, material may fail, and
men, too, may fail sometimes; but more often men, when they are given
the chance, will prove themselves truer than steel, that wonderful thin
steel from which the sides and the bulkheads of our modern sea-leviathans
are made.</p>
<h3>CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE ADMIRABLE INQUIRY INTO THE LOSS OF THE TITANIC&mdash;1912</h3>
<p>I have been taken to task by a friend of mine on the &ldquo;other
side&rdquo; for my strictures on Senator Smith&rsquo;s investigation
into the loss of the <i>Titanic</i>, in the number of <i>The English
Review</i> for May, 1912.&nbsp; I will admit that the motives of the
investigation may have been excellent, and probably were; my criticism
bore mainly on matters of form and also on the point of efficiency.&nbsp;
In that respect I have nothing to retract.&nbsp; The Senators of the
Commission had absolutely no knowledge and no practice to guide them
in the conduct of such an investigation; and this fact gave an air of
unreality to their zealous exertions.&nbsp; I think that even in the
United States there is some regret that this zeal of theirs was not
tempered by a large dose of wisdom.&nbsp; It is fitting that people
who rush with such ardour to the work of putting questions to men yet
gasping from a narrow escape should have, I wouldn&rsquo;t say a tincture
of technical information, but enough knowledge of the subject to direct
the trend of their inquiry.&nbsp; The newspapers of two continents have
noted the remarks of the President of the Senatorial Commission with
comments which I will not reproduce here, having a scant respect for
the &ldquo;organs of public opinion,&rdquo; as they fondly believe themselves
to be.&nbsp; The absolute value of their remarks was about as great
as the value of the investigation they either mocked at or extolled.&nbsp;
To the United States Senate I did not intend to be disrespectful.&nbsp;
I have for that body, of which one hears mostly in connection with tariffs,
as much reverence as the best of Americans.&nbsp; To manifest more or
less would be an impertinence in a stranger.&nbsp; I have expressed
myself with less reserve on our Board of Trade.&nbsp; That was done
under the influence of warm feelings.&nbsp; We were all feeling warmly
on the matter at that time.&nbsp; But, at any rate, our Board of Trade
Inquiry, conducted by an experienced President, discovered a very interesting
fact on the very second day of its sitting: the fact that the water-tight
doors in the bulkheads of that wonder of naval architecture could be
opened down below by any irresponsible person.&nbsp; Thus the famous
closing apparatus on the bridge, paraded as a device of greater safety,
with its attachments of warning bells, coloured lights, and all these
pretty-pretties, was, in the case of this ship, little better than a
technical farce.</p>
<p>It is amusing, if anything connected with this stupid catastrophe
can be amusing, to see the secretly crestfallen attitude of technicians.&nbsp;
They are the high priests of the modern cult of perfected material and
of mechanical appliances, and would fain forbid the profane from inquiring
into its mysteries.&nbsp; We are the masters of progress, they say,
and you should remain respectfully silent.&nbsp; And they take refuge
behind their mathematics.&nbsp; I have the greatest regard for mathematics
as an exercise of mind.&nbsp; It is the only manner of thinking which
approaches the Divine.&nbsp; But mere calculations, of which these men
make so much, when unassisted by imagination and when they have gained
mastery over common sense, are the most deceptive exercises of intellect.&nbsp;
Two and two are four, and two are six.&nbsp; That is immutable; you
may trust your soul to that; but you must be certain first of your quantities.&nbsp;
I know how the strength of materials can be calculated away, and also
the evidence of one&rsquo;s senses.&nbsp; For it is by some sort of
calculation involving weights and levels that the technicians responsible
for the <i>Titanic</i> persuaded themselves that a ship <i>not divided</i>
by water-tight compartments could be &ldquo;unsinkable.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Because, you know, she was not divided.&nbsp; You and I, and our little
boys, when we want to divide, say, a box, take care to procure a piece
of wood which will reach from the bottom to the lid.&nbsp; We know that
if it does not reach all the way up, the box will not be divided into
two compartments.&nbsp; It will be only partly divided.&nbsp; The <i>Titanic</i>
was only partly divided.&nbsp; She was just sufficiently divided to
drown some poor devils like rats in a trap.&nbsp; It is probable that
they would have perished in any case, but it is a particularly horrible
fate to die boxed up like this.&nbsp; Yes, she was sufficiently divided
for that, but not sufficiently divided to prevent the water flowing
over.</p>
<p>Therefore to a plain man who knows something of mathematics but is
not bemused by calculations, she was, from the point of view of &ldquo;unsinkability,&rdquo;
not divided at all.&nbsp; What would you say of people who would boast
of a fireproof building, an hotel, for instance, saying, &ldquo;Oh,
we have it divided by fireproof bulkheads which would localise any outbreak,&rdquo;
and if you were to discover on closer inspection that these bulkheads
closed no more than two-thirds of the openings they were meant to close,
leaving above an open space through which draught, smoke, and fire could
rush from one end of the building to the other?&nbsp; And, furthermore,
that those partitions, being too high to climb over, the people confined
in each menaced compartment had to stay there and become asphyxiated
or roasted, because no exits to the outside, say to the roof, had been
provided!&nbsp; What would you think of the intelligence or candour
of these advertising people?&nbsp; What would you think of them?&nbsp;
And yet, apart from the obvious difference in the action of fire and
water, the cases are essentially the same.</p>
<p>It would strike you and me and our little boys (who are not engineers
yet) that to approach&mdash;I won&rsquo;t say attain&mdash;somewhere
near absolute safety, the divisions to keep out water should extend
from the bottom right up to the uppermost deck of <i>the hull</i>.&nbsp;
I repeat, the <i>hull</i>, because there are above the hull the decks
of the superstructures of which we need not take account.&nbsp; And
further, as a provision of the commonest humanity, that each of these
compartments should have a perfectly independent and free access to
that uppermost deck: that is, into the open.&nbsp; Nothing less will
do.&nbsp; Division by bulkheads that really divide, and free access
to the deck from every water-tight compartment.&nbsp; Then the responsible
man in the moment of danger and in the exercise of his judgment could
close all the doors of these water-tight bulkheads by whatever clever
contrivance has been invented for the purpose, without a qualm at the
awful thought that he may be shutting up some of his fellow creatures
in a death-trap; that he may be sacrificing the lives of men who, down
there, are sticking to the posts of duty as the engine-room staffs of
the Merchant Service have never failed to do.&nbsp; I know very well
that the engineers of a ship in a moment of emergency are not quaking
for their lives, but, as far as I have known them, attend calmly to
their duty.&nbsp; We all must die; but, hang it all, a man ought to
be given a chance, if not for his life, then at least to die decently.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s bad enough to have to stick down there when something disastrous
is going on and any moment may be your last; but to be drowned shut
up under deck is too bad.&nbsp; Some men of the <i>Titanic</i> died
like that, it is to be feared.&nbsp; Compartmented, so to speak.&nbsp;
Just think what it means!&nbsp; Nothing can approach the horror of that
fate except being buried alive in a cave, or in a mine, or in your family
vault.</p>
<p>So, once more: continuous bulkheads&mdash;a clear way of escape to
the deck out of each water-tight compartment.&nbsp; Nothing less.&nbsp;
And if specialists, the precious specialists of the sort that builds
&ldquo;unsinkable ships,&rdquo; tell you that it cannot be done, don&rsquo;t
you believe them.&nbsp; It can be done, and they are quite clever enough
to do it too.&nbsp; The objections they will raise, however disguised
in the solemn mystery of technical phrases, will not be technical, but
commercial.&nbsp; I assure you that there is not much mystery about
a ship of that sort.&nbsp; She is a tank.&nbsp; She is a tank ribbed,
joisted, stayed, but she is no greater mystery than a tank.&nbsp; The
<i>Titanic</i> was a tank eight hundred feet long, fitted as an hotel,
with corridors, bed-rooms, halls, and so on (not a very mysterious arrangement
truly), and for the hazards of her existence I should think about as
strong as a Huntley and Palmer biscuit-tin.&nbsp; I make this comparison
because Huntley and Palmer biscuit-tins, being almost a national institution,
are probably known to all my readers.&nbsp; Well, about that strong,
and perhaps not quite so strong.&nbsp; Just look at the side of such
a tin, and then think of a 50,000 ton ship, and try to imagine what
the thickness of her plates should be to approach anywhere the relative
solidity of that biscuit-tin.&nbsp; In my varied and adventurous career
I have been thrilled by the sight of a Huntley and Palmer biscuit-tin
kicked by a mule sky-high, as the saying is.&nbsp; It came back to earth
smiling, with only a sort of dimple on one of its cheeks.&nbsp; A proportionately
severe blow would have burst the side of the <i>Titanic</i> or any other
&ldquo;triumph of modern naval architecture&rdquo; like brown paper&mdash;I
am willing to bet.</p>
<p>I am not saying this by way of disparagement.&nbsp; There is reason
in things.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t make a 50,000 ton ship as strong as
a Huntley and Palmer biscuit-tin.&nbsp; But there is also reason in
the way one accepts facts, and I refuse to be awed by the size of a
tank bigger than any other tank that ever went afloat to its doom.&nbsp;
The people responsible for her, though disconcerted in their hearts
by the exposure of that disaster, are giving themselves airs of superiority&mdash;priests
of an Oracle which has failed, but still must remain the Oracle.&nbsp;
The assumption is that they are ministers of progress.&nbsp; But the
mere increase of size is not progress.&nbsp; If it were, elephantiasis,
which causes a man&rsquo;s legs to become as large as tree-trunks, would
be a sort of progress, whereas it is nothing but a very ugly disease.&nbsp;
Yet directly this very disconcerting catastrophe happened, the servants
of the silly Oracle began to cry: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use!&nbsp; You
can&rsquo;t resist progress.&nbsp; The big ship has come to stay.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Well, let her stay on, then, in God&rsquo;s name!&nbsp; But she isn&rsquo;t
a servant of progress in any sense.&nbsp; She is the servant of commercialism.&nbsp;
For progress, if dealing with the problems of a material world, has
some sort of moral aspect&mdash;if only, say, that of conquest, which
has its distinct value since man is a conquering animal.&nbsp; But bigness
is mere exaggeration.&nbsp; The men responsible for these big ships
have been moved by considerations of profit to be made by the questionable
means of pandering to an absurd and vulgar demand for banal luxury&mdash;the
seaside hotel luxury.&nbsp; One even asks oneself whether there was
such a demand?&nbsp; It is inconceivable to think that there are people
who can&rsquo;t spend five days of their life without a suite of apartments,
caf&eacute;s, bands, and such-like refined delights.&nbsp; I suspect
that the public is not so very guilty in this matter.&nbsp; These things
were pushed on to it in the usual course of trade competition.&nbsp;
If to-morrow you were to take all these luxuries away, the public would
still travel.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t despair of mankind.&nbsp; I believe
that if, by some catastrophic miracle all ships of every kind were to
disappear off the face of the waters, together with the means of replacing
them, there would be found, before the end of the week, men (millionaires,
perhaps) cheerfully putting out to sea in bath-tubs for a fresh start.&nbsp;
We are all like that.&nbsp; This sort of spirit lives in mankind still
uncorrupted by the so-called refinements, the ingenuity of tradesmen,
who look always for something new to sell, offers to the public.</p>
<p>Let her stay,&mdash;I mean the big ship&mdash;since she has come
to stay.&nbsp; I only object to the attitude of the people, who, having
called her into being and having romanced (to speak politely) about
her, assume a detached sort of superiority, goodness only knows why,
and raise difficulties in the way of every suggestion&mdash;difficulties
about boats, about bulkheads, about discipline, about davits, all sorts
of difficulties.&nbsp; To most of them the only answer would be: &ldquo;Where
there&rsquo;s a will there&rsquo;s a way&rdquo;&mdash;the most wise
of proverbs.&nbsp; But some of these objections are really too stupid
for anything.&nbsp; I shall try to give an instance of what I mean.</p>
<p>This Inquiry is admirably conducted.&nbsp; I am not alluding to the
lawyers representing &ldquo;various interests,&rdquo; who are trying
to earn their fees by casting all sorts of mean aspersions on the characters
of all sorts of people not a bit worse than themselves.&nbsp; It is
honest to give value for your wages; and the &ldquo;bravos&rdquo; of
ancient Venice who kept their stilettos in good order and never failed
to deliver the stab bargained for with their employers, considered themselves
an honest body of professional men, no doubt.&nbsp; But they don&rsquo;t
compel my admiration, whereas the conduct of this Inquiry does.&nbsp;
And as it is pretty certain to be attacked, I take this opportunity
to deposit here my nickel of appreciation.&nbsp; Well, lately, there
came before it witnesses responsible for the designing of the ship.&nbsp;
One of them was asked whether it would not be advisable to make each
coal-bunker of the ship a water-tight compartment by means of a suitable
door.</p>
<p>The answer to such a question should have been, &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo;
for it is obvious to the simplest intelligence that the more water-tight
spaces you provide in a ship (consistently with having her workable)
the nearer you approach safety.&nbsp; But instead of admitting the expediency
of the suggestion, this witness at once raised an objection as to the
possibility of closing tightly the door of a bunker on account of the
slope of coal.&nbsp; This with the true expert&rsquo;s attitude of &ldquo;My
dear man, you don&rsquo;t know what you are talking about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now would you believe that the objection put forward was absolutely
futile?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know whether the distinguished President
of the Court perceived this.&nbsp; Very likely he did, though I don&rsquo;t
suppose he was ever on terms of familiarity with a ship&rsquo;s bunker.&nbsp;
But I have.&nbsp; I have been inside; and you may take it that what
I say of them is correct.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t wish to be wearisome to
the benevolent reader, but I want to put his finger, so to speak, on
the inanity of the objection raised by the expert.&nbsp; A bunker is
an enclosed space for holding coals, generally located against the ship&rsquo;s
side, and having an opening, a doorway in fact, into the stokehold.&nbsp;
Men called trimmers go in there, and by means of implements called slices
make the coal run through that opening on to the floor of the stokehold,
where it is within reach of the stokers&rsquo; (firemen&rsquo;s) shovels.&nbsp;
This being so, you will easily understand that there is constantly a
more or less thick layer of coal generally shaped in a slope lying in
that doorway.&nbsp; And the objection of the expert was: that because
of this obstruction it would be impossible to close the water-tight
door, and therefore that the thing could not be done.&nbsp; And that
objection was inane.&nbsp; A water-tight door in a bulkhead may be defined
as a metal plate which is made to close a given opening by some mechanical
means.&nbsp; And if there were a law of Medes and Persians that a water-tight
door should always slide downwards and never otherwise, the objection
would be to a great extent valid.&nbsp; But what is there to prevent
those doors to be fitted so as to move upwards, or horizontally, or
slantwise?&nbsp; In which case they would go through the obstructing
layer of coal as easily as a knife goes through butter.&nbsp; Anyone
may convince himself of it by experimenting with a light piece of board
and a heap of stones anywhere along our roads.&nbsp; Probably the joint
of such a door would weep a little&mdash;and there is no necessity for
its being hermetically tight&mdash;but the object of converting bunkers
into spaces of safety would be attained.&nbsp; You may take my word
for it that this could be done without any great effort of ingenuity.&nbsp;
And that is why I have qualified the expert&rsquo;s objection as inane.</p>
<p>Of course, these doors must not be operated from the bridge because
of the risk of trapping the coal-trimmers inside the bunker; but on
the signal of all other water-tight doors in the ship being closed (as
would be done in case of a collision) they too could be closed on the
order of the engineer of the watch, who would see to the safety of the
trimmers.&nbsp; If the rent in the ship&rsquo;s side were within the
bunker itself, that would become manifest enough without any signal,
and the rush of water into the stokehold could be cut off directly the
doorplate came into its place.&nbsp; Say a minute at the very outside.&nbsp;
Naturally, if the blow of a right-angled collision, for instance, were
heavy enough to smash through the inner bulkhead of the bunker, why,
there would be then nothing to do but for the stokers and trimmers and
everybody in there to clear out of the stoke-room.&nbsp; But that does
not mean that the precaution of having water-tight doors to the bunkers
is useless, superfluous, or impossible. <a name="citation7"></a><a href="#footnote7">{7}</a></p>
<p>And talking of stokeholds, firemen, and trimmers, men whose heavy
labour has not a single redeeming feature; which is unhealthy, uninspiring,
arduous, without the reward of personal pride in it; sheer, hard, brutalising
toil, belonging neither to earth nor sea, I greet with joy the advent
for marine purposes of the internal combustion engine.&nbsp; The disappearance
of the marine boiler will be a real progress, which anybody in sympathy
with his kind must welcome.&nbsp; Instead of the unthrifty, unruly,
nondescript crowd the boilers require, a crowd of men <i>in</i> the
ship but not <i>of</i> her, we shall have comparatively small crews
of disciplined, intelligent workers, able to steer the ship, handle
anchors, man boats, and at the same time competent to take their place
at a bench as fitters and repairers; the resourceful and skilled seamen&mdash;mechanics
of the future, the legitimate successors of these seamen&mdash;sailors
of the past, who had their own kind of skill, hardihood, and tradition,
and whose last days it has been my lot to share.</p>
<p>One lives and learns and hears very surprising things&mdash;things
that one hardly knows how to take, whether seriously or jocularly, how
to meet&mdash;with indignation or with contempt?&nbsp; Things said by
solemn experts, by exalted directors, by glorified ticket-sellers, by
officials of all sorts.&nbsp; I suppose that one of the uses of such
an inquiry is to give such people enough rope to hang themselves with.&nbsp;
And I hope that some of them won&rsquo;t neglect to do so.&nbsp; One
of them declared two days ago that there was &ldquo;nothing to learn
from the catastrophe of the <i>Titanic</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; That he had
been &ldquo;giving his best consideration&rdquo; to certain rules for
ten years, and had come to the conclusion that nothing ever happened
at sea, and that rules and regulations, boats and sailors, were unnecessary;
that what was really wrong with the <i>Titanic</i> was that she carried
too many boats.</p>
<p>No; I am not joking.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t believe me, pray look
back through the reports and you will find it all there.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
recollect the official&rsquo;s name, but it ought to have been Pooh-Bah.&nbsp;
Well, Pooh-Bah said all these things, and when asked whether he really
meant it, intimated his readiness to give the subject more of &ldquo;his
best consideration&rdquo;&mdash;for another ten years or so apparently&mdash;but
he believed, oh yes! he was certain, that had there been fewer boats
there would have been more people saved.&nbsp; Really, when reading
the report of this admirably conducted inquiry one isn&rsquo;t certain
at times whether it is an Admirable Inquiry or a felicitous <i>op&eacute;ra-bouffe</i>
of the Gilbertian type&mdash;with a rather grim subject, to be sure.</p>
<p>Yes, rather grim&mdash;but the comic treatment never fails.&nbsp;
My readers will remember that in the number of <i>The English Review</i>
for May, 1912, I quoted the old case of the <i>Arizona</i>, and went
on from that to prophesy the coming of a new seamanship (in a spirit
of irony far removed from fun) at the call of the sublime builders of
unsinkable ships.&nbsp; I thought that, as a small boy of my acquaintance
says, I was &ldquo;doing a sarcasm,&rdquo; and regarded it as a rather
wild sort of sarcasm at that.&nbsp; Well, I am blessed (excuse the vulgarism)
if a witness has not turned up who seems to have been inspired by the
same thought, and evidently longs in his heart for the advent of the
new seamanship.&nbsp; He is an expert, of course, and I rather believe
he&rsquo;s the same gentleman who did not see his way to fit water-tight
doors to bunkers.&nbsp; With ludicrous earnestness he assured the Commission
of his intense belief that had only the <i>Titanic</i> struck end-on
she would have come into port all right.&nbsp; And in the whole tone
of his insistent statement there was suggested the regret that the officer
in charge (who is dead now, and mercifully outside the comic scope of
this inquiry) was so ill-advised as to try to pass clear of the ice.&nbsp;
Thus my sarcastic prophecy, that such a suggestion was sure to turn
up, receives an unexpected fulfilment.&nbsp; You will see yet that in
deference to the demands of &ldquo;progress&rdquo; the theory of the
new seamanship will become established: &ldquo;Whatever you see in front
of you&mdash;ram it fair. . .&rdquo;&nbsp; The new seamanship!&nbsp;
Looks simple, doesn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; But it will be a very exact art
indeed.&nbsp; The proper handling of an unsinkable ship, you see, will
demand that she should be made to hit the iceberg very accurately with
her nose, because should you perchance scrape the bluff of the bow instead,
she may, without ceasing to be as unsinkable as before, find her way
to the bottom.&nbsp; I congratulate the future Transatlantic passengers
on the new and vigorous sensations in store for them.&nbsp; They shall
go bounding across from iceberg to iceberg at twenty-five knots with
precision and safety, and a &ldquo;cheerful bumpy sound&rdquo;&mdash;as
the immortal poem has it.&nbsp; It will be a teeth-loosening, exhilarating
experience.&nbsp; The decorations will be Louis-Quinze, of course, and
the caf&eacute; shall remain open all night.&nbsp; But what about the
priceless S&egrave;vres porcelain and the Venetian glass provided for
the service of Transatlantic passengers?&nbsp; Well, I am afraid all
that will have to be replaced by silver goblets and plates.&nbsp; Nasty,
common, cheap silver.&nbsp; But those who <i>will</i> go to sea must
be prepared to put up with a certain amount of hardship.</p>
<p>And there shall be no boats.&nbsp; Why should there be no boats?&nbsp;
Because Pooh-Bah has said that the fewer the boats, the more people
can be saved; and therefore with no boats at all, no one need be lost.&nbsp;
But even if there was a flaw in this argument, pray look at the other
advantages the absence of boats gives you.&nbsp; There can&rsquo;t be
the annoyance of having to go into them in the middle of the night,
and the unpleasantness, after saving your life by the skin of your teeth,
of being hauled over the coals by irreproachable members of the Bar
with hints that you are no better than a cowardly scoundrel and your
wife a heartless monster.&nbsp; Less Boats.&nbsp; No boats!&nbsp; Great
should be the gratitude of passage-selling Combines to Pooh-Bah; and
they ought to cherish his memory when he dies.&nbsp; But no fear of
that.&nbsp; His kind never dies.&nbsp; All you have to do, O Combine,
is to knock at the door of the Marine Department, look in, and beckon
to the first man you see.&nbsp; That will be he, very much at your service&mdash;prepared
to affirm after &ldquo;ten years of my best consideration&rdquo; and
a bundle of statistics in hand, that: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no lesson
to be learned, and that there is nothing to be done!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On an earlier day there was another witness before the Court of Inquiry.&nbsp;
A mighty official of the White Star Line.&nbsp; The impression of his
testimony which the Report gave is of an almost scornful impatience
with all this fuss and pother.&nbsp; Boats!&nbsp; Of course we have
crowded our decks with them in answer to this ignorant clamour.&nbsp;
Mere lumber!&nbsp; How can we handle so many boats with our davits?&nbsp;
Your people don&rsquo;t know the conditions of the problem.&nbsp; We
have given these matters our best consideration, and we have done what
we thought reasonable.&nbsp; We have done more than our duty.&nbsp;
We are wise, and good, and impeccable.&nbsp; And whoever says otherwise
is either ignorant or wicked.</p>
<p>This is the gist of these scornful answers which disclose the psychology
of commercial undertakings.&nbsp; It is the same psychology which fifty
or so years ago, before Samuel Plimsoll uplifted his voice, sent overloaded
ships to sea.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t we cram in as much cargo
as our ships will hold?&nbsp; Look how few, how very few of them get
lost, after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Men don&rsquo;t change.&nbsp; Not very much.&nbsp; And the only answer
to be given to this manager who came out, impatient and indignant, from
behind the plate-glass windows of his shop to be discovered by this
inquiry, and to tell us that he, they, the whole three million (or thirty
million, for all I know) capital Organisation for selling passages has
considered the problem of boats&mdash;the only answer to give him is:
that this is not a problem of boats at all.&nbsp; It is the problem
of decent behaviour.&nbsp; If you can&rsquo;t carry or handle so many
boats, then don&rsquo;t cram quite so many people on board.&nbsp; It
is as simple as that&mdash;this problem of right feeling and right conduct,
the real nature of which seems beyond the comprehension of ticket-providers.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t sell so many tickets, my virtuous dignitary.&nbsp; After
all, men and women (unless considered from a purely commercial point
of view) are not exactly the cattle of the Western-ocean trade, that
used some twenty years ago to be thrown overboard on an emergency and
left to swim round and round before they sank.&nbsp; If you can&rsquo;t
get more boats, then sell less tickets.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t drown so many
people on the finest, calmest night that was ever known in the North
Atlantic&mdash;even if you have provided them with a little music to
get drowned by.&nbsp; Sell less tickets!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the solution
of the problem, your Mercantile Highness.</p>
<p>But there would be a cry, &ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; This requires consideration!&rdquo;&nbsp;
(Ten years of it&mdash;eh?)&nbsp; Well, no!&nbsp; This does not require
consideration.&nbsp; This is the very first thing to do.&nbsp; At once.&nbsp;
Limit the number of people by the boats you can handle.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
honesty.&nbsp; And then you may go on fumbling for years about these
precious davits which are such a stumbling-block to your humanity.&nbsp;
These fascinating patent davits.&nbsp; These davits that refuse to do
three times as much work as they were meant to do.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; The
wickedness of these davits!</p>
<p>One of the great discoveries of this admirable Inquiry is the fascination
of the davits.&nbsp; All these people positively can&rsquo;t get away
from them.&nbsp; They shuffle about and groan around their davits.&nbsp;
Whereas the obvious thing to do is to eliminate the man-handled davits
altogether.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think that with all the mechanical
contrivances, with all the generated power on board these ships, it
is about time to get rid of the hundred-years-old, man-power appliances?&nbsp;
Cranes are what is wanted; low, compact cranes with adjustable heads,
one to each set of six or nine boats.&nbsp; And if people tell you of
insuperable difficulties, if they tell you of the swing and spin of
spanned boats, don&rsquo;t you believe them.&nbsp; The heads of the
cranes need not be any higher than the heads of the davits.&nbsp; The
lift required would be only a couple of inches.&nbsp; As to the spin,
there is a way to prevent that if you have in each boat two men who
know what they are about.&nbsp; I have taken up on board a heavy ship&rsquo;s
boat, in the open sea (the ship rolling heavily), with a common cargo
derrick.&nbsp; And a cargo derrick is very much like a crane; but a
crane devised <i>ad hoc</i> would be infinitely easier to work.&nbsp;
We must remember that the loss of this ship has altered the moral atmosphere.&nbsp;
As long as the <i>Titanic</i> is remembered, an ugly rush for the boats
may be feared in case of some accident.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t hope to
drill into perfect discipline a casual mob of six hundred firemen and
waiters, but in a ship like the <i>Titanic</i> you can keep on a permanent
trustworthy crew of one hundred intelligent seamen and mechanics who
would know their stations for abandoning ship and would do the work
efficiently.&nbsp; The boats could be lowered with sufficient dispatch.&nbsp;
One does not want to let rip one&rsquo;s boats by the run all at the
same time.&nbsp; With six boat-cranes, six boats would be simultaneously
swung, filled, and got away from the side; and if any sort of order
is kept, the ship could be cleared of the passengers in a quite short
time.&nbsp; For there must be boats enough for the passengers and crew,
whether you increase the number of boats or limit the number of passengers,
irrespective of the size of the ship.&nbsp; That is the only honest
course.&nbsp; Any other would be rather worse than putting sand in the
sugar, for which a tradesman gets fined or imprisoned.&nbsp; Do not
let us take a romantic view of the so-called progress.&nbsp; A company
selling passages is a tradesman; though from the way these people talk
and behave you would think they are benefactors of mankind in some mysterious
way, engaged in some lofty and amazing enterprise.</p>
<p>All these boats should have a motor-engine in them.&nbsp; And, of
course, the glorified tradesman, the mummified official, the technicians,
and all these secretly disconcerted hangers-on to the enormous ticket-selling
enterprise, will raise objections to it with every air of superiority.&nbsp;
But don&rsquo;t believe them.&nbsp; Doesn&rsquo;t it strike you as absurd
that in this age of mechanical propulsion, of generated power, the boats
of such ultra-modern ships are fitted with oars and sails, implements
more than three thousand years old?&nbsp; Old as the siege of Troy.&nbsp;
Older! . . . And I know what I am talking about.&nbsp; Only six weeks
ago I was on the river in an ancient, rough, ship&rsquo;s boat, fitted
with a two-cylinder motor-engine of 7.5 h.p.&nbsp; Just a common ship&rsquo;s
boat, which the man who owns her uses for taking the workmen and stevedores
to and from the ships loading at the buoys off Greenhithe.&nbsp; She
would have carried some thirty people.&nbsp; No doubt has carried as
many daily for many months.&nbsp; And she can tow a twenty-five ton
water barge&mdash;which is also part of that man&rsquo;s business.</p>
<p>It was a boisterous day, half a gale of wind against the flood tide.&nbsp;
Two fellows managed her.&nbsp; A youngster of seventeen was cox (and
a first-rate cox he was too); a fellow in a torn blue jersey, not much
older, of the usual riverside type, looked after the engine.&nbsp; I
spent an hour and a half in her, running up and down and across that
reach.&nbsp; She handled perfectly.&nbsp; With eight or twelve oars
out she could not have done anything like as well.&nbsp; These two youngsters
at my request kept her stationary for ten minutes, with a touch of engine
and helm now and then, within three feet of a big, ugly mooring buoy
over which the water broke and the spray flew in sheets, and which would
have holed her if she had bumped against it.&nbsp; But she kept her
position, it seemed to me, to an inch, without apparently any trouble
to these boys.&nbsp; You could not have done it with oars.&nbsp; And
her engine did not take up the space of three men, even on the assumption
that you would pack people as tight as sardines in a box.</p>
<p>Not the room of three people, I tell you!&nbsp; But no one would
want to pack a boat like a sardine-box.&nbsp; There must be room enough
to handle the oars.&nbsp; But in that old ship&rsquo;s boat, even if
she had been desperately overcrowded, there was power (manageable by
two riverside youngsters) to get away quickly from a ship&rsquo;s side
(very important for your safety and to make room for other boats), the
power to keep her easily head to sea, the power to move at five to seven
knots towards a rescuing ship, the power to come safely alongside.&nbsp;
And all that in an engine which did not take up the room of three people.</p>
<p>A poor boatman who had to scrape together painfully the few sovereigns
of the price had the idea of putting that engine into his boat.&nbsp;
But all these designers, directors, managers, constructors, and others
whom we may include in the generic name of Yamsi, never thought of it
for the boats of the biggest tank on earth, or rather on sea.&nbsp;
And therefore they assume an air of impatient superiority and make objections&mdash;however
sick at heart they may be.&nbsp; And I hope they are; at least, as much
as a grocer who has sold a tin of imperfect salmon which destroyed only
half a dozen people.&nbsp; And you know, the tinning of salmon was &ldquo;progress&rdquo;
as much at least as the building of the <i>Titanic</i>.&nbsp; More,
in fact.&nbsp; I am not attacking shipowners.&nbsp; I care neither more
nor less for Lines, Companies, Combines, and generally for Trade arrayed
in purple and fine linen than the Trade cares for me.&nbsp; But I am
attacking foolish arrogance, which is fair game; the offensive posture
of superiority by which they hide the sense of their guilt, while the
echoes of the miserably hypocritical cries along the alley-ways of that
ship: &ldquo;Any more women?&nbsp; Any more women?&rdquo; linger yet
in our ears.</p>
<p>I have been expecting from one or the other of them all bearing the
generic name of Yamsi, something, a sign of some sort, some sincere
utterance, in the course of this Admirable Inquiry, of manly, of genuine
compunction.&nbsp; In vain.&nbsp; All trade talk.&nbsp; Not a whisper&mdash;except
for the conventional expression of regret at the beginning of the yearly
report&mdash;which otherwise is a cheerful document.&nbsp; Dividends,
you know.&nbsp; The shop is doing well.</p>
<p>And the Admirable Inquiry goes on, punctuated by idiotic laughter,
by paid-for cries of indignation from under legal wigs, bringing to
light the psychology of various commercial characters too stupid to
know that they are giving themselves away&mdash;an admirably laborious
inquiry into facts that speak, nay shout, for themselves.</p>
<p>I am not a soft-headed, humanitarian faddist.&nbsp; I have been ordered
in my time to do dangerous work; I have ordered, others to do dangerous
work; I have never ordered a man to do any work I was not prepared to
do myself.&nbsp; I attach no exaggerated value to human life.&nbsp;
But I know it has a value for which the most generous contributions
to the Mansion House and &ldquo;Heroes&rdquo; funds cannot pay.&nbsp;
And they cannot pay for it, because people, even of the third class
(excuse my plain speaking), are not cattle.&nbsp; Death has its sting.&nbsp;
If Yamsi&rsquo;s manager&rsquo;s head were forcibly held under the water
of his bath for some little time, he would soon discover that it has.&nbsp;
Some people can only learn from that sort of experience which comes
home to their own dear selves.</p>
<p>I am not a sentimentalist; therefore it is not a great consolation
to me to see all these people breveted as &ldquo;Heroes&rdquo; by the
penny and halfpenny Press.&nbsp; It is no consolation at all.&nbsp;
In extremity, in the worst extremity, the majority of people, even of
common people, will behave decently.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a fact of which
only the journalists don&rsquo;t seem aware.&nbsp; Hence their enthusiasm,
I suppose.&nbsp; But I, who am not a sentimentalist, think it would
have been finer if the band of the <i>Titanic</i> had been quietly saved,
instead of being drowned while playing&mdash;whatever tune they were
playing, the poor devils.&nbsp; I would rather they had been saved to
support their families than to see their families supported by the magnificent
generosity of the subscribers.&nbsp; I am not consoled by the false,
written-up, Drury Lane aspects of that event, which is neither drama,
nor melodrama, nor tragedy, but the exposure of arrogant folly.&nbsp;
There is nothing more heroic in being drowned very much against your
will, off a holed, helpless, big tank in which you bought your passage,
than in dying of colic caused by the imperfect salmon in the tin you
bought from your grocer.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the truth.&nbsp; The unsentimental truth stripped
of the romantic garment the Press has wrapped around this most unnecessary
disaster.</p>
<h3>PROTECTION OF OCEAN LINERS <a name="citation8"></a><a href="#footnote8">{8}</a>&mdash;1914</h3>
<p>The loss of the <i>Empress of Ireland</i> awakens feelings somewhat
different from those the sinking of the <i>Titanic</i> had called up
on two continents.&nbsp; The grief for the lost and the sympathy for
the survivors and the bereaved are the same; but there is not, and there
cannot be, the same undercurrent of indignation.&nbsp; The good ship
that is gone (I remember reading of her launch something like eight
years ago) had not been ushered in with beat of drum as the chief wonder
of the world of waters.&nbsp; The company who owned her had no agents,
authorised or unauthorised, giving boastful interviews about her unsinkability
to newspaper reporters ready to swallow any sort of trade statement
if only sensational enough for their readers&mdash;readers as ignorant
as themselves of the nature of all things outside the commonest experience
of the man in the street.</p>
<p>No; there was nothing of that in her case.&nbsp; The company was
content to have as fine, staunch, seaworthy a ship as the technical
knowledge of that time could make her.&nbsp; In fact, she was as safe
a ship as nine hundred and ninety-nine ships out of any thousand now
afloat upon the sea.&nbsp; No; whatever sorrow one can feel, one does
not feel indignation.&nbsp; This was not an accident of a very boastful
marine transportation; this was a real casualty of the sea.&nbsp; The
indignation of the New South Wales Premier flashed telegraphically to
Canada is perfectly uncalled-for.&nbsp; That statesman, whose sympathy
for poor mates and seamen is so suspect to me that I wouldn&rsquo;t
take it at fifty per cent. discount, does not seem to know that a British
Court of Marine Inquiry, ordinary or extraordinary, is not a contrivance
for catching scapegoats.&nbsp; I, who have been seaman, mate and master
for twenty years, holding my certificate under the Board of Trade, may
safely say that none of us ever felt in danger of unfair treatment from
a Court of Inquiry.&nbsp; It is a perfectly impartial tribunal which
has never punished seamen for the faults of shipowners&mdash;as, indeed,
it could not do even if it wanted to.&nbsp; And there is another thing
the angry Premier of New South Wales does not know.&nbsp; It is this:
that for a ship to float for fifteen minutes after receiving such a
blow by a bare stem on her bare side is not so bad.</p>
<p>She took a tremendous list which made the minutes of grace vouchsafed
her of not much use for the saving of lives.&nbsp; But for that neither
her owners nor her officers are responsible.&nbsp; It would have been
wonderful if she had not listed with such a hole in her side.&nbsp;
Even the <i>Aquitania</i> with such an opening in her outer hull would
be bound to take a list.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t say this with the intention
of disparaging this latest &ldquo;triumph of marine architecture&rdquo;&mdash;to
use the consecrated phrase.&nbsp; The <i>Aquitania</i> is a magnificent
ship.&nbsp; I believe she would bear her people unscathed through ninety-nine
per cent. of all possible accidents of the sea.&nbsp; But suppose a
collision out on the ocean involving damage as extensive as this one
was, and suppose then a gale of wind coming on.&nbsp; Even the <i>Aquitania</i>
would not be quite seaworthy, for she would not be manageable.</p>
<p>We have been accustoming ourselves to put our trust in material,
technical skill, invention, and scientific contrivances to such an extent
that we have come at last to believe that with these things we can overcome
the immortal gods themselves.&nbsp; Hence when a disaster like this
happens, there arises, besides the shock to our humane sentiments, a
feeling of irritation, such as the hon. gentleman at the head of the
New South Wales Government has discharged in a telegraphic flash upon
the world.</p>
<p>But it is no use being angry and trying to hang a threat of penal
servitude over the heads of the directors of shipping companies.&nbsp;
You can&rsquo;t get the better of the immortal gods by the mere power
of material contrivances.&nbsp; There will be neither scapegoats in
this matter nor yet penal servitude for anyone.&nbsp; The Directors
of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company did not sell &ldquo;safety at
sea&rdquo; to the people on board the <i>Empress of Ireland</i>.&nbsp;
They never in the slightest degree pretended to do so.&nbsp; What they
did was to sell them a sea-passage, giving very good value for the money.&nbsp;
Nothing more.&nbsp; As long as men will travel on the water, the sea-gods
will take their toll.&nbsp; They will catch good seamen napping, or
confuse their judgment by arts well known to those who go to sea, or
overcome them by the sheer brutality of elemental forces.&nbsp; It seems
to me that the resentful sea-gods never do sleep, and are never weary;
wherein the seamen who are mere mortals condemned to unending vigilance
are no match for them.</p>
<p>And yet it is right that the responsibility should be fixed.&nbsp;
It is the fate of men that even in their contests with the immortal
gods they must render an account of their conduct.&nbsp; Life at sea
is the life in which, simple as it is, you can&rsquo;t afford to make
mistakes.</p>
<p>With whom the mistake lies here, is not for me to say.&nbsp; I see
that Sir Thomas Shaughnessy has expressed his opinion of Captain Kendall&rsquo;s
absolute innocence.&nbsp; This statement, premature as it is, does him
honour, for I don&rsquo;t suppose for a moment that the thought of the
material issue involved in the verdict of the Court of Inquiry influenced
him in the least.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t suppose that he is more impressed
by the writ of two million dollars nailed (or more likely pasted) to
the foremast of the Norwegian than I am, who don&rsquo;t believe that
the <i>Storstad</i> is worth two million shillings.&nbsp; This is merely
a move of commercial law, and even the whole majesty of the British
Empire (so finely invoked by the Sheriff) cannot squeeze more than a
very moderate quantity of blood out of a stone.&nbsp; Sir Thomas, in
his confident pronouncement, stands loyally by a loyal and distinguished
servant of his company.</p>
<p>This thing has to be investigated yet, and it is not proper for me
to express my opinion, though I have one, in this place and at this
time.&nbsp; But I need not conceal my sympathy with the vehement protestations
of Captain Andersen.&nbsp; A charge of neglect and indifference in the
matter of saving lives is the cruellest blow that can be aimed at the
character of a seaman worthy of the name.&nbsp; On the face of the facts
as known up to now the charge does not seem to be true.&nbsp; If upwards
of three hundred people have been, as stated in the last reports, saved
by the <i>Storstad</i>, then that ship must have been at hand and rendering
all the assistance in her power.</p>
<p>As to the point which must come up for the decision of the Court
of Inquiry, it is as fine as a hair.&nbsp; The two ships saw each other
plainly enough before the fog closed on them.&nbsp; No one can question
Captain Kendall&rsquo;s prudence.&nbsp; He has been as prudent as ever
he could be.&nbsp; There is not a shadow of doubt as to that.</p>
<p>But there is this question: Accepting the position of the two ships
when they saw each other as correctly described in the very latest newspaper
reports, it seems clear that it was the <i>Empress of Ireland&rsquo;s</i>
duty to keep clear of the collier, and what the Court will have to decide
is whether the stopping of the liner was, under the circumstances, the
best way of keeping her clear of the other ship, which had the right
to proceed cautiously on an unchanged course.</p>
<p>This, reduced to its simplest expression, is the question which the
Court will have to decide.</p>
<p>And now, apart from all problems of manoeuvring, of rules of the
road, of the judgment of the men in command, away from their possible
errors and from the points the Court will have to decide, if we ask
ourselves what it was that was needed to avert this disaster costing
so many lives, spreading so much sorrow, and to a certain point shocking
the public conscience&mdash;if we ask that question, what is the answer
to be?</p>
<p>I hardly dare set it down.&nbsp; Yes; what was it that was needed,
what ingenious combinations of ship-building, what transverse bulkheads,
what skill, what genius&mdash;how much expense in money and trained
thinking, what learned contriving, to avert that disaster?</p>
<p>To save that ship, all these lives, so much anguish for the dying,
and so much grief for the bereaved, all that was needed in this particular
case in the way of science, money, ingenuity, and seamanship was a man,
and a cork-fender.</p>
<p>Yes; a man, a quartermaster, an able seaman that would know how to
jump to an order and was not an excitable fool.&nbsp; In my time at
sea there was no lack of men in British ships who could jump to an order
and were not excitable fools.&nbsp; As to the so-called cork-fender,
it is a sort of soft balloon made from a net of thick rope rather more
than a foot in diameter.&nbsp; It is such a long time since I have indented
for cork-fenders that I don&rsquo;t remember how much these things cost
apiece.&nbsp; One of them, hung judiciously over the side at the end
of its lanyard by a man who knew what he was about, might perhaps have
saved from destruction the ship and upwards of a thousand lives.</p>
<p>Two men with a heavy rope-fender would have been better, but even
the other one might have made all the difference between a very damaging
accident and downright disaster.&nbsp; By the time the cork-fender had
been squeezed between the liner&rsquo;s side and the bluff of the <i>Storstad&rsquo;s</i>
bow, the effect of the latter&rsquo;s reversed propeller would have
been produced, and the ships would have come apart with no more damage
than bulged and started plates.&nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t there lying about
on that liner&rsquo;s bridge, fitted with all sorts of scientific contrivances,
a couple of simple and effective cork-fenders&mdash;or on board of that
Norwegian either?&nbsp; There must have been, since one ship was just
out of a dock or harbour and the other just arriving.&nbsp; That is
the time, if ever, when cork-fenders are lying about a ship&rsquo;s
decks.&nbsp; And there was plenty of time to use them, and exactly in
the conditions in which such fenders are effectively used.&nbsp; The
water was as smooth as in any dock; one ship was motionless, the other
just moving at what may be called dock-speed when entering, leaving,
or shifting berths; and from the moment the collision was seen to be
unavoidable till the actual contact a whole minute elapsed.&nbsp; A
minute,&mdash;an age under the circumstances.&nbsp; And no one thought
of the homely expedient of dropping a simple, unpretending rope-fender
between the destructive stern and the defenceless side!</p>
<p>I appeal confidently to all the seamen in the still United Kingdom,
from his Majesty the King (who has been really at sea) to the youngest
intelligent A.B. in any ship that will dock next tide in the ports of
this realm, whether there was not a chance there.&nbsp; I have followed
the sea for more than twenty years; I have seen collisions; I have been
involved in a collision myself; and I do believe that in the case under
consideration this little thing would have made all that enormous difference&mdash;the
difference between considerable damage and an appalling disaster.</p>
<p>Many letters have been written to the Press on the subject of collisions.&nbsp;
I have seen some.&nbsp; They contain many suggestions, valuable and
otherwise; but there is only one which hits the nail on the head.&nbsp;
It is a letter to the <i>Times</i> from a retired Captain of the Royal
Navy.&nbsp; It is printed in small type, but it deserved to be printed
in letters of gold and crimson.&nbsp; The writer suggests that all steamers
should be obliged by law to carry hung over their stern what we at sea
call a &ldquo;pudding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This solution of the problem is as wonderful in its simplicity as
the celebrated trick of Columbus&rsquo;s egg, and infinitely more useful
to mankind.&nbsp; A &ldquo;pudding&rdquo; is a thing something like
a bolster of stout rope-net stuffed with old junk, but thicker in the
middle than at the ends.&nbsp; It can be seen on almost every tug working
in our docks.&nbsp; It is, in fact, a fixed rope-fender always in a
position where presumably it would do most good.&nbsp; Had the <i>Storstad</i>
carried such a &ldquo;pudding&rdquo; proportionate to her size (say,
two feet diameter in the thickest part) across her stern, and hung above
the level of her hawse-pipes, there would have been an accident certainly,
and some repair-work for the nearest ship-yard, but there would have
been no loss of life to deplore.</p>
<p>It seems almost too simple to be true, but I assure you that the
statement is as true as anything can be.&nbsp; We shall see whether
the lesson will be taken to heart.&nbsp; We shall see.&nbsp; There is
a Commission of learned men sitting to consider the subject of saving
life at sea.&nbsp; They are discussing bulkheads, boats, davits, manning,
navigation, but I am willing to bet that not one of them has thought
of the humble &ldquo;pudding.&rdquo;&nbsp; They can make what rules
they like.&nbsp; We shall see if, with that disaster calling aloud to
them, they will make the rule that every steamship should carry a permanent
fender across her stern, from two to four feet in diameter in its thickest
part in proportion to the size of the ship.&nbsp; But perhaps they may
think the thing too rough and unsightly for this scientific and &aelig;sthetic
age.&nbsp; It certainly won&rsquo;t look very pretty but I make bold
to say it will save more lives at sea than any amount of the Marconi
installations which are being forced on the shipowners on that very
ground&mdash;the safety of lives at sea.</p>
<p>We shall see!</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>To the Editor of the <i>Daily Express</i>.</p>
<p>SIR,</p>
<p>As I fully expected, this morning&rsquo;s post brought me not a few
letters on the subject of that article of mine in the <i>Illustrated
London News</i>.&nbsp; And they are very much what I expected them to
be.</p>
<p>I shall address my reply to Captain Littlehales, since obviously
he can speak with authority, and speaks in his own name, not under a
pseudonym.&nbsp; And also for the reason that it is no use talking to
men who tell you to shut your head for a confounded fool.&nbsp; They
are not likely to listen to you.</p>
<p>But if there be in Liverpool anybody not too angry to listen, I want
to assure him or them that my exclamatory line, &ldquo;Was there no
one on board either of these ships to think of dropping a fender&mdash;etc.,&rdquo;
was not uttered in the spirit of blame for anyone.&nbsp; I would not
dream of blaming a seaman for doing or omitting to do anything a person
sitting in a perfectly safe and unsinkable study may think of.&nbsp;
All my sympathy goes to the two captains; much the greater share of
it to Captain Kendall, who has lost his ship and whose load of responsibility
was so much heavier!&nbsp; I may not know a great deal, but I know how
anxious and perplexing are those nearly end-on approaches, so infinitely
more trying to the men in charge than a frank right-angle crossing.</p>
<p>I may begin by reminding Captain Littlehales that I, as well as himself,
have had to form my opinion, or rather my vision, of the accident, from
printed statements, of which many must have been loose and inexact and
none could have been minutely circumstantial.&nbsp; I have read the
reports of the <i>Times</i> and the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, and no others.&nbsp;
What stands in the columns of these papers is responsible for my conclusion&mdash;or
perhaps for the state of my feelings when I wrote the <i>Illustrated
London News</i> article.</p>
<p>From these sober and unsensational reports, I derived the impression
that this collision was a collision of the slowest sort.&nbsp; I take
it, of course, that both the men in charge speak the strictest truth
as to preliminary facts.&nbsp; We know that the <i>Empress of Ireland</i>
was for a time lying motionless.&nbsp; And if the captain of the <i>Storstad</i>
stopped his engines directly the fog came on (as he says he did), then
taking into account the adverse current of the river, the <i>Storstad</i>,
by the time the two ships sighted each other again, must have been barely
moving <i>over the ground</i>.&nbsp; The &ldquo;over the ground&rdquo;
speed is the only one that matters in this discussion.&nbsp; In fact,
I represented her to myself as just creeping on ahead&mdash;no more.&nbsp;
This, I contend, is an imaginative view (and we can form no other) not
utterly absurd for a seaman to adopt.</p>
<p>So much for the imaginative view of the sad occurrence which caused
me to speak of the fender, and be chided for it in unmeasured terms.&nbsp;
Not by Captain Littlehales, however, and I wish to reply to what he
says with all possible deference.&nbsp; His illustration borrowed from
boxing is very apt, and in a certain sense makes for my contention.&nbsp;
Yes.&nbsp; A blow delivered with a boxing-glove will draw blood or knock
a man out; but it would not crush in his nose flat or break his jaw
for him&mdash;at least, not always.&nbsp; And this is exactly my point.</p>
<p>Twice in my sea life I have had occasion to be impressed by the preserving
effect of a fender.&nbsp; Once I was myself the man who dropped it over.&nbsp;
Not because I was so very clever or smart, but simply because I happened
to be at hand.&nbsp; And I agree with Captain Littlehales that to see
a steamer&rsquo;s stern coming at you at the rate of only two knots
is a staggering experience.&nbsp; The thing seems to have power enough
behind it to cut half through the terrestrial globe.</p>
<p>And perhaps Captain Littlehales is right?&nbsp; It may be that I
am mistaken in my appreciation of circumstances and possibilities in
this case&mdash;or in any such case.&nbsp; Perhaps what was really wanted
there was an extraordinary man and an extraordinary fender.&nbsp; I
care nothing if possibly my deep feeling has betrayed me into something
which some people call absurdity.</p>
<p>Absurd was the word applied to the proposal for carrying &ldquo;enough
boats for all&rdquo; on board the big liners.&nbsp; And my absurdity
can affect no lives, break no bones&mdash;need make no one angry.&nbsp;
Why should I care, then, as long as out of the discussion of my absurdity
there will emerge the acceptance of the suggestion of Captain F. Papillon,
R.N., for the universal and compulsory fitting of very heavy collision
fenders on the stems of all mechanically propelled ships?</p>
<p>An extraordinary man we cannot always get from heaven on order, but
an extraordinary fender that will do its work is well within the power
of a committee of old boatswains to plan out, make, and place in position.&nbsp;
I beg to ask, not in a provocative spirit, but simply as to a matter
of fact which he is better qualified to judge than I am&mdash;Will Captain
Littlehales affirm that if the <i>Storstad</i> had carried, slung securely
across the stem, even nothing thicker than a single bale of wool (an
ordinary, hand-pressed, Australian wool-bale), it would have made no
difference?</p>
<p>If scientific men can invent an air cushion, a gas cushion, or even
an electricity cushion (with wires or without), to fit neatly round
the stems and bows of ships, then let them go to work, in God&rsquo;s
name and produce another &ldquo;marvel of science&rdquo; without loss
of time.&nbsp; For something like this has long been due&mdash;too long
for the credit of that part of mankind which is not absurd, and in which
I include, among others, such people as marine underwriters, for instance.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, turning to materials I am familiar with, I would put my
trust in canvas, lots of big rope, and in large, very large quantities
of old junk.</p>
<p>It sounds awfully primitive, but if it will mitigate the mischief
in only fifty per cent. of cases, is it not well worth trying?&nbsp;
Most collisions occur at slow speeds, and it ought to be remembered
that in case of a big liner&rsquo;s loss, involving many lives, she
is generally sunk by a ship much smaller than herself.</p>
<p>JOSEPH CONRAD.</p>
<h3>A FRIENDLY PLACE</h3>
<p>Eighteen years have passed since I last set foot in the London Sailors&rsquo;
Home.&nbsp; I was not staying there then; I had gone in to try to find
a man I wanted to see.&nbsp; He was one of those able seamen who, in
a watch, are a perfect blessing to a young officer.&nbsp; I could perhaps
remember here and there among the shadows of my sea-life a more daring
man, or a more agile man, or a man more expert in some special branch
of his calling&mdash;such as wire splicing, for instance; but for all-round
competence, he was unequalled.&nbsp; As character he was sterling stuff.&nbsp;
His name was Anderson.&nbsp; He had a fine, quiet face, kindly eyes,
and a voice which matched that something attractive in the whole man.&nbsp;
Though he looked yet in the prime of life, shoulders, chest, limbs untouched
by decay, and though his hair and moustache were only iron-grey, he
was on board ship generally called Old Andy by his fellows.&nbsp; He
accepted the name with some complacency.</p>
<p>I made my enquiry at the highly-glazed entry office.&nbsp; The clerk
on duty opened an enormous ledger, and after running his finger down
a page, informed me that Anderson had gone to sea a week before, in
a ship bound round the Horn.&nbsp; Then, smiling at me, he added: &ldquo;Old
Andy.&nbsp; We know him well, here.&nbsp; What a nice fellow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I, who knew what a &ldquo;good man,&rdquo; in a sailor sense, he
was, assented without reserve.&nbsp; Heaven only knows when, if ever,
he came back from that voyage, to the Sailors&rsquo; Home of which he
was a faithful client.</p>
<p>I went out glad to know he was safely at sea, but sorry not to have
seen him; though, indeed, if I had, we would not have exchanged more
than a score of words, perhaps.&nbsp; He was not a talkative man, Old
Andy, whose affectionate ship-name clung to him even in that Sailors&rsquo;
Home, where the staff understood and liked the sailors (those men without
a home) and did its duty by them with an unobtrusive tact, with a patient
and humorous sense of their idiosyncrasies, to which I hasten to testify
now, when the very existence of that institution is menaced after so
many years of most useful work.</p>
<p>Walking away from it on that day eighteen years ago, I was far from
thinking it was for the last time.&nbsp; Great changes have come since,
over land and sea; and if I were to seek somebody who knew Old Andy
it would be (of all people in the world) Mr. John Galsworthy.&nbsp;
For Mr. John Galsworthy, Andy, and myself have been shipmates together
in our different stations, for some forty days in the Indian Ocean in
the early nineties.&nbsp; And, but for us two, Old Andy&rsquo;s very
memory would be gone from this changing earth.</p>
<p>Yes, things have changed&mdash;the very sky, the atmosphere, the
light of judgment which falls on the labours of men, either splendid
or obscure.&nbsp; Having been asked to say a word to the public on behalf
of the Sailors&rsquo; Home, I felt immensely flattered&mdash;and troubled.&nbsp;
Flattered to have been thought of in that connection; troubled to find
myself in touch again with that past so deeply rooted in my heart.&nbsp;
And the illusion of nearness is so great while I trace these lines that
I feel as if I were speaking in the name of that worthy Sailor-Shade
of Old Andy, whose faithfully hard life seems to my vision a thing of
yesterday.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>But though the past keeps firm hold on one, yet one feels with the
same warmth that the men and the institutions of to-day have their merit
and their claims.&nbsp; Others will know how to set forth before the
public the merit of the Sailors&rsquo; Home in the eloquent terms of
hard facts and some few figures.&nbsp; For myself, I can only bring
a personal note, give a glimpse of the human side of the good work for
sailors ashore, carried on through so many decades with a perfect understanding
of the end in view.&nbsp; I have been in touch with the Sailors&rsquo;
Home for sixteen years of my life, off and on; I have seen the changes
in the staff and I have observed the subtle alterations in the physiognomy
of that stream of sailors passing through it, in from the sea and out
again to sea, between the years 1878 and 1894.&nbsp; I have listened
to the talk on the decks of ships in all latitudes, when its name would
turn up frequently, and if I had to characterise its good work in one
sentence, I would say that, for seamen, the Well Street Home was a friendly
place.</p>
<p>It was essentially just that; quietly, unobtrusively, with a regard
for the independence of the men who sought its shelter ashore, and with
no ulterior aims behind that effective friendliness.&nbsp; No small
merit this.&nbsp; And its claim on the generosity of the public is derived
from a long record of valuable public service.&nbsp; Since we are all
agreed that the men of the merchant service are a national asset worthy
of care and sympathy, the public could express this sympathy no better
than by enabling the Sailors&rsquo; Home, so useful in the past, to
continue its friendly offices to the seamen of future generations.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
