      SCENE I.
    </h3>
    <p>
      CURTAIN RISES DISCLOSING CARVIL <i>and Bessie moving away from sea-wall.
      Bessie about twenty-five. Black dress; black straw hat. A lot of
      mahogany-coloured hair loosely done up. Pale face. Full figure. Very
      quiet. Carvil, blind, unwieldy. Reddish whiskers; slow, deep voice
      produced without effort. Immovable, big face.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Carvil (<i>Hanging heavily on Bessie's arm</i>). Careful! Go slow! (<i>Stops;
      Bessie waits patiently</i>.) Want your poor blind father to break his
      neck? (<i>Shuffles on</i>.) In a hurry to get home and start that
      everlasting yarn with your chum the lunatic?
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. I am not in a hurry to get home, father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carvil. Well, then, go steady with a poor blind man. Blind! Helpless! (<i>Strikes
      the ground with his stick</i>.) Never mind! I've had time to make enough
      money to have ham and eggs for breakfast every morning&mdash;thank God!
      And thank God, too, for it, girl. You haven't known a single hardship in
      all the days of your idle life. Unless you think that a blind, helpless
      father&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. What is there for me to be in a hurry for?
    </p>
    <p>
      Carvil. What did you say?
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. I said there was nothing for me to hurry home for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carvil. There is, tho'. To yarn with a lunatic. Anything to get away from
      your duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. Captain Hagberd's talk never hurt you or anybody else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carvil. Go on. Stick up for your only friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. Is it my fault that I haven't another soul to speak to?
    </p>
    <p>
      Carvil (<i>Snarls</i>). It's mine, perhaps. Can I help being blind? You
      fret because you want to be gadding about&mdash;with a helpless man left
      all alone at home. Your own father too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. I haven't been away from you half a day since mother died.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carvil (<i>Viciously</i>). He's a lunatic, our landlord is. That's what he
      is. Has been for years&mdash;long before those damned doctors destroyed my
      sight for me. (<i>Growls angrily, then sighs</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. Perhaps Captain Hagberd is not so mad as the town takes him for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carvil. (<i>Grimly</i>). Don't everybody know how he came here from the
      North to wait till his missing son turns up&mdash;here&mdash;of all places
      in the world. His boy that ran away to sea sixteen years ago and never did
      give a sign of life since! Don't I remember seeing people dodge round
      corners out of his way when he came along High Street. Seeing him, I tell
      you. (<i>Groan</i>.) He bothered everybody so with his silly talk of his
      son being sure to come back home&mdash;next year&mdash;next spring&mdash;next
      month&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. What is it by this time, hey?
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. Why talk about it? He bothers no one now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carvil. No. They've grown too fly. You've got only to pass a remark on his
      sail-cloth coat to make him shut up. All the town knows it. But he's got
      you to listen to his crazy talk whenever he chooses. Don't I hear you two
      at it, jabber, jabber, mumble, mumble&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. What is there so mad in keeping up hope?
    </p>
    <p>
      Carvil (<i>Scathing scorn</i>). Not mad! Starving himself to lay money by&mdash;for
      that son. Filling his house with furniture he won't let anyone see&mdash;for
      that son. Advertising in the papers every week, these sixteen years&mdash;for
      that son. Not mad! Boy, he calls him. Boy Harry. His boy Harry. His lost
      boy Harry. Yah! Let him lose his sight to know what real trouble means.
      And the boy&mdash;the man, I should say&mdash;must 've been put away safe
      in Davy Jones's locker for many a year&mdash;drowned&mdash;food for fishes&mdash;dead....
      Stands to reason, or he would have been here before, smelling around the
      old fool's money. (<i>Shakes Bessie's arm slightly</i>.) Hey?
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. I don't know. May be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carvil (<i>Bursting out</i>). Damme if I don't think he ever had a son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. Poor man. Perhaps he never had.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carvil. Ain't that mad enough for you? But I suppose you think it
      sensible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. What does it matter? His talk keeps him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carvil. Aye! And it pleases you. Anything to get away from your poor blind
      father.... Jabber, jabber&mdash;mumble, mumble&mdash;till I begin to think
      you must be as crazy as he is. What do you find to talk about, you two?
      What's your game?
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>During the scene Carvil and Bessie have crossed stage from L. to R.
      slowly with stoppages</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. It's warm. Will you sit out for a while?
    </p>
    <p>
      Carvil (<i>Viciously</i>). Yes, I will sit out. (<i>Insistent</i>.) But
      what can be your game? What are you up to? (<i>They pass through garden
      gate</i>.) Because if it's his money you are after&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. Father! How can you!
    </p>
    <p>
      Carvil (<i>Disregarding her</i>). To make you independent of your poor
      blind father, then you are a fool. (<i>Drops heavily on seat</i>.) He's
      too much of a miser to ever make a will&mdash;even if he weren't mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. Oh! It never entered my head. I swear it never did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carvil. Never did. Hey! Then you are a still bigger fool.... I want to go
      to sleep! (<i>Takes off' his hat, drops it on ground, and leans his head
      back against the wall</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. And I have been a good daughter to you. Won't you say that for me?
    </p>
    <p>
      Carvil (<i>Very distinctly</i>). I want&mdash;to&mdash;go&mdash;to&mdash;sleep.
      I'm tired. (<i>Closes his eyes</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>During that scene Captain Hagberd has been seen hesitating at the back
      of stage, then running quickly to the door of his cottage. He puts inside
      a tin kettle (from under his coat) and comes down to the railing between
      the two gardens stealthily</i>).

    <h2>
      SCENE II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Carvil seated. Bessie. Captain Hagberd (white beard, sail-cloth jacket</i>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Knitting</i>). You've been out this afternoon for quite a long
      time, haven't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. Hagberd (<i>Eager</i>). Yes, my dear. (<i>Slily</i>) Of course you
      saw me come back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. Oh, yes. I did see you. You had something under your coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. H. (<i>Anxiously</i>). It was only a kettle, my dear. A tin
      water-kettle. I am glad I thought of it just in time. (<i>Winks, nods</i>.)
      When a husband gets back from his work he needs a lot of water for a wash.
      See? (<i>Dignified</i>.) Not that Harry'll ever need to do a hand's turn
      after he comes home... (<i>Falters&mdash;casts stealthy glances on all
      sides</i>).... tomorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Looks up, grave</i>). Captain Hagberd, have you ever thought
      that perhaps your son will not. . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. H. (<i>Paternally</i>). I've thought of everything, my dear&mdash;of
      everything a reasonable young couple may need for housekeeping. Why, I can
      hardly turn about in my room up there, the house is that full. (<i>Rubs
      his hands with satisfaction</i>.) For my son Harry&mdash;when he comes
      home. One day more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Flattering</i>). Oh, you are a great one for bargains. (<i>Captain
      Hagberd delighted</i>.) But, Captain Hagberd&mdash;if&mdash;if&mdash;you
      don't know what may happen&mdash;if all that home you've got together were
      to be wasted&mdash;for nothing&mdash;after all. (<i>Aside</i>.) Oh, I
      can't bring it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. H. (<i>Agitated; flings arms up, stamps feet; stuttering</i>). What?
      What d'ye mean? What's going to happen to the things?
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Soothing</i>). Nothing! Nothing! Dust&mdash;or moth&mdash;you
      know. Damp, perhaps. You never let anyone into the house . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. H. Dust! Damp! (<i>Has a throaty, gurgling laugh</i>.) I light the
      fires and dust the things myself. (<i>Indignant</i>.) Let anyone into the
      house, indeed! What would Harry say! (<i>Walks up and down his garden
      hastily with tosses, jings, and jerks of his whole body</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>With authority</i>.) Now, then, Captain Hagberd! You know I
      won't put up with your tantrums. (<i>Shakes finger at him</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. H. (<i>Subdued, but still sulky, with his back to her</i>). You want
      to see the things. That's what you're after. Well, no, not even you. Not
      till Harry has had his first look.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. Oh, no! I don't. (<i>Relenting</i>.) Not till you're willing. (<i>Smiles
      at Capt. H., who has turned half round already!</i>) You mustn't excite
      yourself. (<i>Knits</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. H. (<i>Condescending</i>). And you the only sensible girl for miles
      and miles around. Can't you trust me? I am a domestic man. Always was, my
      dear. I hated the sea. People don't know what they let their boys into
      when they send them to sea. As soon make convicts of them at once. What
      sort of life is it? Most of your time you don't know what's going on at
      home. (<i>Insinuating</i>.) There's nothing anywhere on earth as good as a
      home, my dear. (<i>Pause</i>.) With a good husband...
    </p>
    <p>
      Carvil (<i>Heard from his seat fragmentarily</i>). There they go...
      jabber, jabber... mumble, mumble. (<i>With a groaning effort?</i>)
      Helpless!
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. H. (<i>Mutters</i>). Extravagant ham and eggs fellow. (<i>Louder</i>.)
      Of course it isn't as if he had a son to make a home ready for. Girls are
      different, my dear. They don't run away, my dear, my dear. (<i>Agitated</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Drops her arms wearily</i>). No, Captain Hagberd&mdash;they
      don't.
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. H. (<i>Slowly</i>). I wouldn't let my own flesh and blood go to sea.
      Not I.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. And the boy ran away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. H. (<i>A little vacantly</i>). Yes, my only son Harry. (<i>Rouses
      himself</i>.) Coming home to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Speaks softly</i>). Sometimes, Captain Hagberd, a hope turns
      out false.
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. H. (<i>Uneasy</i>). What's that got to do with Harry's coming back?
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. It's good to hope for something. But suppose now&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-(<i>Feeling
      her way</i>.) Yours is not the only lost son that's never...
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. H. Never what! You don't believe he's drowned. (<i>Crouches, glaring
      and grasping the rails</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Frightened, drops knitting</i>). Captain Hagberd&mdash;don't. (<i>Catches
      hold of his shoulders over the railings?</i>) Don't&mdash;my God! He's
      going out of his mind! (<i>Cries</i>.) I didn't mean it! I don't know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. H. (<i>Has backed away. An affected burst of laughter</i>). What
      nonsense. None of us Hagberds belonged to the sea. All farmers for
      hundreds of years, (<i>fraternal and cunning?</i>) Don't alarm yourself,
      my dear. The sea can't get us. Look at me! I didn't get drowned. Moreover,
      Harry ain't a sailor at all. And if he isn't a sailor, he's bound to come
      back&mdash;to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Has been facing him; murmurs</i>). No. I give it up. He scares
      me. (<i>Aloud, sharply</i>.) Then I would give up that advertising in the
      papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. H. (<i>Surprised and puzzled</i>). Why, my dear? Everybody does it.
      His poor mother and I have been advertising for years and years. But she
      was an impatient woman. She died.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. If your son's coming, as&mdash;as you say&mdash;what's the good of
      that expense? You had better spend that half-crown on yourself. I believe
      you don't eat enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. H. (<i>Confused</i>). But it's the right thing to do. Look at the
      Sunday papers. Missing relatives on top page&mdash;all proper. (<i>Looks
      unhappy</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Tartly</i>). Ah, well! I declare I don't know what you live on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. H. Are you getting impatient, my dear? Don't get impatient&mdash;like
      my poor wife. If she'd only been patient she'd be here. Waiting. Only one
      day more. (<i>Pleadingly</i>.) Don't be impatient, my dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. I've no patience with you sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. H. (<i>Flash of lucidity</i>). Why? What's the matter? (<i>Sympathetic</i>.)
      You're tired out, my dear, that's what it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. Yes, I am. Day after day. (<i>Stands listless, arms hanging down</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. H. (<i>Timidly</i>). House dull?
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Apathetic</i>). Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. H. (<i>As before</i>). H'm. Wash, cook, scrub. Hey?
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>As before</i>). Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. H. (<i>Pointing stealthily at the sleeping Carvil</i>). Heavy?
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. (<i>In a dead voice</i>). Like a millstone.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>A silence</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. H. (<i>Burst of indignation</i>). Why don't that extravagant fellow
      get you a servant?
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. I don't know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. H. (<i>Cheerily</i>). Wait till Harry comes home. He'll get you one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Almost hysterical; laughs</i>). Why, Captain Hagberd, perhaps
      your son won't even want to look at me&mdash;when he comes home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. H. (<i>In a great voice</i>). What! (<i>Quite low</i>.) The boy
      wouldn't dare. (<i>Rising choler</i>.) Wouldn't dare to refuse the only
      sensible girl for miles around. That stubborn jackanapes refuse to marry a
      girl like you! (<i>Walks about in a fury</i>.) You trust me, my dear, my
      dear, my dear. I'll make him. I'll&mdash;I'll &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      (<i>Splutters</i>.) Cut him off with a shilling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. Hush! (<i>Severe</i>.) You mustn't talk like that. What's this?
      More of your tantrums?
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. H. (<i>Quite humble</i>). No, no&mdash;this isn't my tantrums&mdash;when
      I don't feel quite well in my head. Only I can't stand this... I've grown
      as fond of you as if you'd been the wife of my Harry already.
    </p>
    <p>
      And to be told&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; (<i>Cant restrain himself;
      shouts</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Jackanapes!
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. Sh&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;! Don't you worry! (<i>Wearily</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      I must give that up too, I suppose. (<i>Aloud</i>.) I didn't mean it,
      Captain Hagberd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. H. It's as if I were to have two children to-morrow. My son Harry&mdash;and
      the only sensible girl&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. Why, my dear, I
      couldn't get on without you. We two are reasonable together. The rest of
      the people in this town are crazy. The way they stare at you. And the
      grins&mdash;they're all on the grin. It makes me dislike to go out. (<i>Bewildered</i>.)
      It seems as if there was something wrong about&mdash;somewhere. My dear,
      is there anything wrong&mdash;you who are sensible.. .
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Soothingly tender</i>). No, no, Captain Hagberd. There is
      nothing wrong about you anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carvil (<i>Lying back</i>). Bessie! (<i>Sits up</i>.) Get my hat,
      Bessie.... Bessie, my hat.... Bessie.... Bessie. ...
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>At the first sound Bessie picks up and puts away her knitting. She
      walks towards him, picks up hat, puts it on his head</i>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie, my... (<i>Hat on head; shouting stops</i>.) Bessie. (<i>Quietly</i>).
      Will you go in, now? Carvil. Help me up. Steady. I'm dizzy. It's the
      thundery weather. An autumn thunderstorm means a bad gale. Very fierce&mdash;and
      sudden. There will be shipwrecks to-night on our coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Exit Bessie and Carvil through door of their cottage. It has fallen
      dusk</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. H. (<i>Picks up spade</i>). Extravagant fellow! And all this town is
      mad&mdash;perfectly mad. I found them out years ago. Thank God they don't
      come this way staring and grinning. I can't bear them. I'll never go again
      into that High Street. (<i>Agitated</i>.) Never, never, never. Won't need
      to after to-morrow. Never! (<i>Flings down spade in passion</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>While Hagberd speaks, the bow window of the Carvils is lit up, and
      Bessie is seen settling her father in a big armchair. Pulls down blind.
      Enter Lamplighter. Capt. H. picks up the spade and leans forward on it
      with both hands; very still, watching him light the lamp</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Lamplighter (<i>Jocular</i>). There! You will be able to dig by lamplight
      if the fancy takes you.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Exit Lamplighter to back</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. H. (<i>Disgusted</i>). Ough! The people here. . . (<i>Shudders</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Lamplighter's Voice (<i>Heard loudly beyond the cottages</i>). Yes, that's
      the way.

    <h3>
      (<i>Capt. H. Harry. Later Bessie</i>).
    </h3>
    <p>
      Harry Hagberd (<i>thirty-one, tall, broad shoulders, shaven face, small
      moustache. Blue serge suit. Coat open. Grey flannel shirt without collar
      and tie. No waistcoat. Belt with buckle. Black, soft felt hat,
      wide-brimmed, worn crushed in the crown and a little on one side. Good
      nature, recklessness, some swagger in the bearing. Assured, deliberate
      walk with a heavy tread. Slight roll in the gait. Walks down. Stops, hands
      in pockets. Looks about. Speaks</i>.) This must be it. Can't see anything
      beyond. There's somebody. (<i>Walks up to Capt. Hagberd's gate?</i>) Can
      you tell me... (<i>Manner changes. Leans elbow on gate?</i>) Why, you must
      be Capt. Hagberd himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. H. (<i>In garden, both hands on spade, peering, startled</i>). Yes,
      I am.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Slowly</i>). You've been advertising in the papers for your son,
      I believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. H. (<i>Off his guard, nervous</i>). Yes. My only boy Harry. He's
      coming home to-morrow. (<i>Mumbles</i>.) For a permanent stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Surprised</i>). The devil he is! (<i>Change of tone?</i>) My
      word! You've grown a beard like Father Christmas himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. H. (<i>Impressively</i>). Go your way. (<i>Waves one hand loftily?</i>)
      What's that to you. Go your way. (<i>Agitated?</i>) Go your way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry. There, there. I am not trespassing in the street&mdash;where I
      stand&mdash;am I? Tell you what, I fancy there's something wrong about
      your news. Suppose you let me come in&mdash;for a quiet chat, you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. H. (<i>Horrified</i>). Let you&mdash;<i>you</i> come in!
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Persuasive</i>). Because I could give you some real information
      about your son. The&mdash;very&mdash;latest&mdash;tip. If you care to
      hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. H. (<i>Explodes</i>). No! I don't care to hear. (<i>Begins to pace
      to and fro, spade on shoulder. Gesticulating with his other arm</i>.)
      Here's a fellow&mdash;a grinning town fellow, who says there's something
      wrong. (<i>Fiercely</i>.) I have got more information than you're aware
      of. I have all the information I want. I have had it for years&mdash;for
      years&mdash;for years&mdash;enough to last me till to-morrow! Let you come
      in, indeed! What would Harry say?
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Bessie Carvil appears at cottage door with a white wrap on her head
      and stands in her garden trying to see</i>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. What's the matter?
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. H. (<i>Beside himself</i>). An information fellow. (<i>Stumbles</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Putting out arm to steady him, gravely</i>). Here! Steady a bit!
      Seems to me somebody's been trying to get at you. (<i>Change of tone</i>.)
      Hullo! What's this rig you've got on?... Storm canvas coat, by George! (<i>He
      gives a frig, throaty laugh</i>.) Well! You <i>are</i> a character!
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. H. (<i>Daunted by the allusion, looks at coat</i>). I&mdash;I wear
      it for&mdash;for the time being. Till&mdash;till&mdash;to-morrow. (<i>Shrinks
      away, spade in hand, to door of his cottage</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (Advancing). And what may you want, sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Turns to Bessie at once; easy manner</i>). I'd like to know
      about this swindle that's going to be sprung on him. I didn't mean to
      startle the old man. You see, on my way here I dropped into a barber's to
      get a twopenny shave, and they told me there that he was something of a
      character. He has been a character all his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Wondering</i>). What swindle?
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. H. A grinning fellow! (<i>Makes sudden dash indoors with the spade.
      Door slams. Affected gurgling laugh within</i>.)

      SCENE IV.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      (<i>Bessie and Harry. Later Capt. H. from window</i>).
    </h3>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>After a short silence</i>). What on earth's upset him so? What's
      the meaning of all this fuss? He isn't always like that, is he?
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. I don't know who you are; but I may tell you that his mind has
      been troubled for years about an only son who ran away from home&mdash;a
      long time ago. Everybody knows that here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Thoughtful</i>). Troubled&mdash;for years! (<i>Suddenly</i>.)
      Well, I am the son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Steps back</i>). You! . .. Harry!
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Amused, dry tone</i>). Got hold of my name, eh? Been making
      friends with the old man?
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Distressed</i>). Yes... I... sometimes. . . (<i>Rapidly!</i>)
      He's our landlord.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Scornfully</i>). Owns both them rabbit hutches, does he? Just a
      thing he'd be proud of... (<i>Earnest</i>.) And now you had better tell me
      all about that chap who's coming to-morrow. Know anything of him? I reckon
      there's more than one in that little game. Come! Out with it! (<i>Chaffing</i>.)
      I don't take no... from women.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Bewildered</i>). Oh! It's so difficult... What had I better
      do?...
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Good-humoured</i>). Make a clean breast of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Wildly to herself</i>). Impossible! (<i>Starts</i>.) You don't
      understand. I must think&mdash;see&mdash;try to&mdash;I, I must have time.
      Plenty of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry. What for? Come. Two words. And don't be afraid for yourself. I
      ain't going to make it a police job. But it's the other fellow that'll get
      upset when he least expects it. There'll be some fun when he shows his mug
      here to-morrow. (<i>Snaps fingers</i>.) I don't care that for the old
      man's dollars, but right is right. You shall see me put a head on that
      coon, whoever he is.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Wrings hands slightly</i>). What had I better do? (<i>Suddenly
      to Harry</i>.) It's you&mdash;you yourself that we&mdash;that he's waiting
      for. It's <i>you</i> who are to come to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Slowly</i>). Oh! it's me! (<i>Perplexed</i>.) There's something
      there I can't understand. I haven't written ahead or anything. It was my
      chum who showed me the advertisement with the old boy's address, this very
      morning&mdash;in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Anxious</i>). How can I make it plain to you without... (<i>Bites
      her lip, embarrassed</i>.) Sometimes he talks so strangely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Expectant</i>). Does he? What about?
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. Only you. And he will stand no contradicting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry. Stubborn. Eh? The old man hasn't changed much from what I can
      remember. (<i>They stand looking at each other helplessly</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. He's made up his mind you would come back . . . to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry. I can't hang about here till morning. Got no money to get a bed.
      Not a cent. But why won't to-day do?
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. Because you've been too long away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>With force</i>). Look here, they fairly drove me out. Poor
      mother nagged at me for being idle, and the old man said he would cut my
      soul out of my body rather than let me go to sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Murmurs</i>). He can bear no contradicting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Continuing</i>). Well, it looked as tho' he would do it too. So
      I went. (<i>Moody</i>.) It seems to me sometimes I was born to them by a
      mistake... in that other rabbit hutch of a house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>A little mocking</i>). And where do you think you ought to have
      been born by rights?
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry. In the open&mdash;upon a beach&mdash;on a windy night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Faintly</i>). Ah!
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry. They were characters, both of them, by George! Shall I try the
      door?
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. Wait. I must explain to you why it is to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry. Aye. That you must, or...
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Window in H.'s cottage runs up</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. H.'s Voice (<i>Above</i>). A&mdash;grinning&mdash;information&mdash;fellow
      coming to worry me in my own garden! What next?
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Window rumbles down</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. Yes. I must. (<i>Lays hand on Harry's sleeve</i>.) Let's get
      further off. Nobody ever comes this way after dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Careless laugh</i>). Aye. A good road for a walk with a girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>They turn their backs on audience and move up the stage slowly. Close
      together. Harry bends his head over Bessie</i>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie's Voice (<i>Beginning eagerly</i>). People here somehow did not
      take kindly to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry's Voice. Aye. Aye. I understand that.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>They walk slowly back towards the front</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. He was almost ready to starve himself for your sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry. And I had to starve more than once for his whim.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. I'm afraid you've a hard heart. (<i>Remains thoughtful</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry. What for? For running away? (<i>Indignant</i>.) Why, he wanted to
      make a blamed lawyer's clerk of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>From here this scene goes on mainly near and about the street lamp</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Rousing herself</i>). What are you? A sailor?
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry. Anything you like. (<i>Proudly</i>.) Sailor enough to be worth my
      salt on board any craft that swims the seas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. He will never, never believe it. He mustn't be contradicted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry. Always liked to have his own way. And you've been encouraging him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Earnestly</i>). No!&mdash;not in everything&mdash;not really!
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Vexed laugh</i>). What about that pretty tomorrow notion? I've a
      hungry chum in London&mdash;waiting for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Defending herself</i>). Why should I make the poor old
      friendless man miserable? I thought you were far away. I thought you were
      dead. I didn't know but you had never been born. I... I... (<i>Harry turns
      to her. She desperately</i>.) It was easier to believe it myself. (<i>Carried
      away</i>.) And after all it's true. It's come to pass. This is the
      to-morrow we've been waiting for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Half perfunctorily</i>). Aye. Anybody can see that your heart is
      as soft as your voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>As if unable to keep back the words</i>). I didn't think you
      would have noticed my voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Already inattentive</i>). H'm. Dashed scrape. This is a queer
      to-morrow, without any sort of today, as far as I can see. (<i>Resolutely</i>.)
      I must try the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. Well&mdash;try, then.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>From gate looking over shoulder at Bessie</i>). He ain't likely
      to fly out at me, is he? I would be afraid of laying my hands on him. The
      chaps are always telling me I don't know my own strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>In front</i>). He's the most harmless creature that ever. ..
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry. You wouldn't say so if you had seen him walloping me with a hard
      leather strap. (<i>Walking up garden</i>.) I haven't forgotten it in
      sixteen long years. (<i>Rat-tat-tat twice</i>.) Hullo, Dad. (<i>Bessie
      intensely expectant. Rat-tat-tat</i>.) Hullo, Dad&mdash;let me in. I am
      your own Harry. Straight. Your son Harry come back home&mdash;a day too
      soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Window above rumbles up</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. H. (<i>Seen leaning out, aiming with spade</i>). Aha! Bessie (<i>Warningly</i>).
      Look out, Harry! (<i>Spade falls</i>.) Are you hurt? (<i>Window rumbles
      down</i>.) Harry (<i>In the distance</i>). Only grazed my hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. Thank God! (<i>Intensely</i>.) What'll he do now?
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Comes forward, slamming gate behind him</i>). Just like old
      times. Nearly licked the life out of me for wanting to go away, and now I
      come back he shies a confounded old shovel at my head. (<i>Fumes. Laughs a
      little</i>). I wouldn't care, only poor little Ginger&mdash;Ginger's my
      chum up in London&mdash;he will starve while I walk back all the way from
      here. (<i>Faces Bessie blankly</i>.) I spent my last twopence on a shave.
      ... Out of respect for the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. I think, if you let me, I could manage to talk him round in a
      week, maybe.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>A muffled periodical bellowing had been heard faintly for some time</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>On the alert</i>). What's this? Who's making this row? Hark!
      Bessie, Bessie. It's in your house, I believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Without stirring, drearily</i>). It's for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Discreetly, whispering</i>). Good voice for a ship's deck in a
      squall. Your husband? (<i>Steps out of lamplight</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. No. My father. He's blind. (<i>Pause</i>). I'm not married.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Bellowings grow louder</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry. Oh, I say. What's up? Who's murdering him?
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Calmly</i>). I expect he's finished his tea. (<i>Bellowing
      continues regularly</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry. Hadn't you better see to it? You'll have the whole town coming out
      here presently. (<i>Bessie moves off</i>.) I say! (<i>Bessie stops</i>.)
      Couldn't you scare up some bread and butter for me from that tea? I'm
      hungry. Had no breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Starts off at the word "hungry," dropping to the ground the
      white woollen shawl</i>). I won't be a minute. Don't go away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Alone; picks up shawl absently, and, looking at it spread out in
      his hands, pronounces slowly</i>). A&mdash;dam'&mdash;silly&mdash;scrape.
      (<i>Pause. Throws shawl on arm. Strolls up and down. Mutters.</i>) No
      money to get back. (<i>Louder</i>.) Silly little Ginger'll think I've got
      hold of the pieces and given an old shipmate the go by. One good shove&mdash;(<i>Makes
      motion of bursting in door with his shoulders</i>)&mdash;would burst that
      door in&mdash;I bet. (<i>Looks about</i>.) I wonder where the nearest
      bobby is! No. They would want to bundle me neck and crop into chokey. (<i>Shudders</i>.)
      Perhaps. It makes me dog sick to think of being locked up. Haven't got the
      nerve. Not for prison. (<i>Leans against lamp-post</i>.) And not a cent
      for my fare. I wonder if that girl now...
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (Coming hastily forward, plate with bread and meat in hand). I
      didn't take time to get anything else....
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Begins to eat</i>). You're not standing treat to a beggar. My
      dad is a rich man&mdash;you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Plate in hand</i>). You resemble your father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry. I was the very image of him in face from a boy&mdash;(<i>Eats</i>)&mdash;and
      that's about as far as it goes. He was always one of your domestic
      characters. He looked sick when he had to go to sea for a fortnight's
      trip. (<i>Laughs</i>.) He was all for house and home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. And you? Have you never wished for a home? (<i>Goes off with empty
      plate and puts it down hastily on Carvil's bench&mdash;out of sight</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Left in front</i>). Home! If I found myself shut up in what the
      old man calls a home, I would kick it down about my ears on the third day&mdash;or
      else go to bed and die before the week was out. Die in a house&mdash;ough!
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Returning; stops and speaks from garden railing</i>). And where
      is it that you would wish to die?
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry. In the bush, in the sea, on some blamed mountain-top for choice. No
      such luck, tho', I suppose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>From distance</i>). Would that be luck? Harry. Yes! For them
      that make the whole world their home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Comes forward shyly</i>). The world's a cold home&mdash;they
      say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>A little gloomy</i>). So it is. When a man's done for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. You see! (<i>Taunting</i>). And a ship's not so very big after
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry. No. But the sea is great. And then what of the ship! You love her
      and leave her, Miss&mdash;Bessie's your name&mdash;isn't it?... I like
      that name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. You like my name! I wonder you remembered it.... That's why, I
      suppose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Slight swagger in voice</i>). What's the odds! As long as a
      fellow has lived. And a voyage isn't a marriage&mdash;as we sailors say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. So you're not married&mdash;(<i>Movement of Harry</i>)&mdash;to
      any ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Soft laugh</i>). Ship! I've loved and left more of them than I
      can remember. I've been nearly everything you can think of but a tinker or
      a soldier; I've been a boundary rider; I've sheared sheep and humped my
      swag and harpooned a whale; I've rigged ships and skinned dead bullocks
      and prospected for gold&mdash;and turned my back on more money than the
      old man would have scraped together in his whole life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Thoughtfully</i>). I could talk him over in a week.. . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Negligently</i>). I dare say you could. (<i>Joking</i>.) I don't
      know but what I could make shift to wait if you only promise to talk to me
      now and then. I've grown quite fond of your voice. I like a right woman's
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Averted head</i>). Quite fond! (<i>Sharply</i>.) Talk!
      Nonsense! Much you'd care. (<i>Businesslike</i>.) Of course I would have
      to sometimes.... (<i>Thoughtful again</i>.) Yes. In a week&mdash;if&mdash;if
      only I knew you would try to get on with him afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Leaning against lamp-post; growls through his teeth</i>). More
      humouring. Ah! well, no! (<i>Hums significantly</i>)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Oh, oh, oh, Rio, . . .
     And fare thee well
     My bonnie young girl,
     We're bound for Rio Grande.
</pre>
    <p>
      Bessie (Shivering). What's this?
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry. Why! The chorus of an up-anchor tune. Kiss and go. A deep-water
      ship's good-bye.... You are cold. Here's that thing of yours I've picked
      up and forgot there on my arm. Turn round a bit. So. (<i>Wraps her up&mdash;commanding</i>.)
      Hold the ends together in front.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Softly</i>). A week is not so very long.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Begins violently</i>). You think that I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Stops with sidelong look at her</i>.) I can't dodge about in ditches
      and live on air and water. Can I? I haven't any money&mdash;you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. He's been scraping and saving up for years. All he has is for you,
      and perhaps...
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Interrupts</i>). Yes. If I come to sit on it like a blamed toad
      in a hole. Thank you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Angrily</i>). What did you come for, then?
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Promptly</i>). For five quid&mdash;(<i>Pause</i>.)&mdash;after a
      jolly good spree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Scathingly</i>). You and that&mdash;that&mdash;chum of yours
      have been drinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Laughs</i>). Don't fly out, Miss Bessie&mdash;dear. Ginger's not
      a bad little chap. Can't take care of himself, tho'. Blind three days. (<i>Serious</i>.)
      Don't think I am given that way. Nothing and nobody can get over me unless
      I like. I can be as steady as a rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Murmurs</i>). Oh! I don't think you are bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Approvingly</i>). You're right there. (<i>Impulsive</i>.) Ask
      the girls all over&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-(<i>Checks himself</i>.) Ginger,
      he's long-headed, too, in his way&mdash;mind you. He sees the paper this
      morning, and says he to me, 'Hallo! Look at that, Harry&mdash;loving
      parent&mdash;that's five quid, sure.' So we scraped all our pockets for
      the fare....
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Unbelieving</i>). You came here for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Surprised</i>). What else would I want here? Five quid isn't
      much to ask for&mdash;once in sixteen years. (<i>Through his teeth with a
      sidelong look at B.</i>) And now I am ready to go&mdash;for my fare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Clasping her hands</i>). Whoever heard a man talk like this
      before! I can't believe you mean it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry. What? That I would go? You just try and see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Disregarding him</i>). Don't you care for anyone? Didn't you
      ever want anyone in the world to care for you?
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry. In the world! (<i>Boastful</i>.) There's hardly a place you can go
      in the world where you wouldn't find somebody that did care for Harry
      Hagberd. (<i>Pause</i>.) I'm not of the sort that go about skulking under
      false names.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. Somebody&mdash;that means a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry. Well! And if it did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Unsteadily</i>). Oh, I see how it is. You get round them with
      your soft speeches, your promises, and then...
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Violently</i>). Never!
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Startled, steps back</i>). Ah&mdash;you never. . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Calm</i>). Never yet told a lie to a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. What lie?
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry. Why, the lie that comes glib to a man's tongue. None of that for
      me. I leave the sneaking off to them soft-spoken chaps you're thinking of.
      No! If you love me you take me. And if you take me&mdash;why, then, the
      capstan-song of deep-water ships is sure to settle it all some fine day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>After a short pause, with effort</i>). It's like your ships,
      then.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Amused</i>). Exactly, up to now. Or else I wouldn't be here in a
      silly fix.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Assumed indifference</i>). Perhaps it's because you've never
      yet met&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;- (<i>Voice fails</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Negligently</i>). Maybe. And perhaps never shall.... What's the
      odds? It's the looking for a thing.... No matter. I love them all&mdash;ships
      and women. The scrapes they got me into, and the scrapes they got me out
      of&mdash;my word! I say, Miss Bessie, what are you thinking of?
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Lifts her head</i>). That you are supposed never to tell a lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry. Never, eh? You wouldn't be that hard on a chap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Recklessly</i>). Never to a woman, I mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry. Well, no. (<i>Serious</i>.) Never anything that matters. (<i>Aside</i>.)
      I don't seem to get any nearer to my railway fare. (<i>Leans wearily
      against the lamppost with a far-off look. B. looks at him</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. Now what are <i>you</i> thinking of?
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Turns his head; stares at B</i>.). Well, I was thinking what a
      fine figure of a girl you are.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Looks away a moment</i>). Is that true, or is it only one of
      them that don't matter?
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Laughing a little</i>). No! no! That's true. Haven't you ever
      been told that before? The men...
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. I hardly speak to a soul from year's end to year's end. Father's
      blind. He don't like strangers, and he can't bear to think of me out of
      his call. Nobody comes near us much.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Absent-minded</i>). Blind&mdash;ah! of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. For years and years . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Commiserating</i>). For years and years. In one of them hutches.
      You are a good daughter. (<i>Brightening up</i>.) A fine girl altogether.
      You seem the sort that makes a good chum to a man in a fix. And there's
      not a man in this whole town who found you out? I can hardly credit it,
      Miss Bessie. (<i>B. shakes her head</i>.) Man I said! (<i>Contemptuous</i>.)
      A lot of tame rabbits in hutches I call them.... (<i>Breaks off</i>.) I
      say, when's the last train up to London? Can you tell me?
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Gazes at him steadily</i>). What for? You've no money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry. That's just it. (<i>Leans back against post again</i>.) Hard luck.
      (<i>Insinuating</i>.) But there was never a time in all my travels that a
      woman of the right sort did not turn up to help me out of a fix. I don't
      know why. It's perhaps because they know without telling that I love them
      all. (<i>Playful</i>.) I've almost fallen in love with you, Miss Bessie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Unsteady laugh</i>). Why! How you talk! You haven't even seen
      my face properly. (<i>One step towards H., as if compelled.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Bending forward gallantly</i>). A little pale. It suits some. (<i>Puts
      out his hand, catches hold of B.'s arm. Draws her to him</i>.) Let's
      see.... Yes, it suits you. (<i>It's a moment before B. puts up her hands,
      palms out, and turns away her head</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Whispering</i>). Don't. (<i>Struggles a little. Released,
      stands averted</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry. No offence. (<i>Stands, back to audience, looking at H.'s cottage</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Alone in front; faces audience; whispers</i>). My voice&mdash;my
      figure&mdash;my heart&mdash;my face....
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>A silence. B. 's face gradually lights up. Directly H. speaks,
      expression of hopeful attention</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>From railings</i>). The old man seems to have gone to sleep
      waiting for that to-morrow of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. Come away. He sleeps very little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Strolls down</i>). He has taken an everlasting jamming hitch
      round the whole business. (<i>Vexed</i>.) Cast it loose who may. (<i>Contemptuous
      exclamation</i>.) To-morrow. Pooh! It'll be just another mad today.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. It's the brooding over his hope that's done it. People teased him
      so. It's his fondness for you that's troubled his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry. Aye. A confounded shovel on the head. The old man had always a
      queer way of showing his fondness for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. A hopeful, troubled, expecting old man&mdash;left alone&mdash;all
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Lower tone</i>). Did he ever tell you what mother died of?
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. Yes. (<i>A little bitter</i>.) From impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Makes a gesture with his arm; speaks vaguely but with feeling</i>).
      I believe you have been very good to my old man....
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Tentative</i>). Wouldn't you try to be a son to him?
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Angrily</i>). No contradicting; is that it? You seem to know my
      dad pretty well. And so do I. He's dead nuts on having his own way&mdash;and
      I've been used to have my own too long. It's the deuce of a fix.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. How could it hurt you not to contradict him for a while&mdash;and
      perhaps in time you would get used. ..
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Interrupts sulkily</i>). I ain't accustomed to knuckle under.
      There's a pair of us. Hagberd's both. I ought to be thinking of my train.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Earnestly</i>). Why? There's no need. Let us get away up the
      road a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Through his teeth</i>). And no money for the fare. (<i>Looks up</i>.)
      Sky's come overcast. Black, too. It'll be a wild, windy night... to walk
      the high road on. But I and wild nights are old friends wherever the free
      wind blows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Entreating</i>). No need. No need. (<i>Looks apprehensively at
      Hagberd's cottage. Takes a couple of steps up as if to draw Harry further
      off. Harry follows. Both stop</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>After waiting</i>). What about this tomorrow whim?
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. Leave that to me. Of course all his fancies are not mad. They
      aren't. (<i>Pause</i>.) Most people in this town would think what he had
      set his mind on quite sensible. If he ever talks to you of it, don't
      contradict him. It would&mdash;it would be dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Surprised</i>). What would he do?
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. He would&mdash;I don't know&mdash;something rash.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Startled</i>). To himself?
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. No. It'd be against you&mdash;I fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Sullen</i>). Let him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. Never. Don't quarrel. But perhaps he won't even try to talk to you
      of it. (<i>Thinking aloud</i>.) Who knows what I can do with him in a
      week! I can, I can, I can&mdash;I must.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry. Come&mdash;what's this sensible notion of his that I mustn't
      quarrel about?
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Turns to Harry, calm, forcible</i>). If I make him once see
      that you've come back, he will be as sane as you or I. All his mad notions
      will be gone. But that other is quite sensible. And you mustn't quarrel
      over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Moves up to back of stage. Harry follows a little behind, away from
      audience</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry's Voice (<i>Calm</i>). Let's hear what it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Voices cease. Action visible as before. Harry steps back and walks
      hastily down. Bessie at his elbow, follows with her hands clasped?</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Loud burst of voice.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Raving to and fro</i>). No! Expects me&mdash;a home. Who wants
      his home?... What I want is hard work, or an all-fired racket, or more
      room than there is in the whole of England. Expects me! A man like me&mdash;for
      his rotten money&mdash;there ain't enough money in the world to turn me
      into a blamed tame rabbit in a hutch. (<i>He stops suddenly before Bessie,
      arms crossed on breast. Violently</i>.) Don't you see it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Terrified, stammering faintly</i>). Yes. Yes. Don't look at me
      like this. (<i>Sudden scream</i>.) Don't quarrel with him. He's mad!
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Headlong utterance</i>). Mad! Not he. He likes his own way. Tie
      me up by the neck here. Here! Ha! Ha! Ha! (<i>Louder</i>.) And the whole
      world is not a bit too big for me to spread my elbows in, I can tell you&mdash;what's
      your name&mdash;Bessie. (<i>Rising scorn</i>). Marry! Wants me to marry
      and settle.... (<i>Scathingly</i>.) And as likely as not he has looked out
      the girl too&mdash;dash my soul. Talked to you about it&mdash;did he? And
      do you happen to know the Judy&mdash;may I ask?
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Window in Hagberd's cottage runs up. They start and stand still</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. H. (<i>Above, begins slowly</i>). A grinning information fellow from
      a crazy town. (<i>Voice changes</i>.) Bessie, I see you. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Shrill</i>). Captain Hagberd! Say nothing. You don't
      understand. For heaven's sake don't.
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. H. Send him away this minute, or I will tell Harry. They know
      nothing of Harry in this crazy town. Harry's coming home to-morrow. Do you
      hear? One day more!
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Silence</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Mutters</i>). Well!&mdash;he <i>is</i> a character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. H. (<i>Chuckles softly</i>). Never you fear! The boy shall marry
      you. (<i>Sudden anger</i>.) He'll have to. I'll make him. Or, if not&mdash;(<i>Furious</i>)&mdash;I'll
      cut him off with a shilling, and leave everything to you. Jackanapes! Let
      him starve!
    </p>

      Harry (<i>Slowly</i>). So it's you&mdash;the girl. It's you! Now I begin
      to see.... By heavens, you have a heart as soft as your woman's voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Half averted, face in hands</i>). You see! Don't come near me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Makes a step towards her</i>). I must have another look at your
      pale face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Turns unexpectedly and pushes him with both hands; Harry
      staggers back and stands still; Bessie, fiercely</i>). Go away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Watching her</i>). Directly. But women always had to get me out
      of my scrapes. I am a beggar now, and you must help me out of my scrape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Who at the word "beggar" had begun fumbling in the pocket of
      her dress, speaks wildly</i>). Here it is. Take it. Don't look at me.
      Don't speak to me!
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Swaggers up under the lamp; looks at coin in his palm</i>).
      Half-a-quid. . .. My fare!
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Hands clenched</i>). Why are you still here?
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry. Well, you <i>are</i> a fine figure of a girl. My word. I've a good
      mind to stop&mdash;for a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Pain and shame</i>). Oh!.... What are you waiting for? If I had
      more money I would give it all, all. I would give everything I have to
      make you go&mdash;to make you forget you had ever heard my voice and seen
      my face. (<i>Covers face with hands</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry (<i>Sombre, watches her</i>). No fear! I haven't forgotten a single
      one of you in the world. Some've given me more than money. No matter. You
      can't buy me in&mdash;and you can't buy yourself out. . .
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Strides towards her. Seizes her arms. Short struggle. Bessie gives
      way. Hair falls loose. H. kisses her forehead, cheeks, lips, then releases
      her. Bessie staggers against railings</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      (Exit Harry; measured walk without haste)
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Staring eyes, hair loose, back against railings; calls out</i>).
      Harry! (<i>Gathers up her skirts and runs a little way</i>) Come back,
      Harry. (<i>Staggers forward against lamp-post</i>) Harry! (<i>Much lower</i>)
      Harry! (<i>In a whisper</i>) Take me with you. (<i>Begins to laugh, at
      first faintly, then louder.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Window rumbles up, and Capt. H.'s chuckle mingles with Bessie's
      laughter, which abruptly stops</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. H. (<i>Goes on chuckling; speaks cautiously</i>). Is he gone yet,
      that information fellow? Do you see him anywhere, my dear?
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Low and stammering</i>). N-no, no! (<i>Totters away from
      lamp-post</i>) I don't see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. H. (<i>Anxious</i>). A grinning vagabond, my dear. Good girl. It's
      you who drove him away. Good girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Stage gradually darkens</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie. Go in; be quiet! You have done harm enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. H. (<i>Alarmed</i>). Why. Do you hear him yet, my dear?
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Sobs, drooping against the railings</i>). No! No! I don't. I
      don't hear him any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. H. (<i>Triumphant</i>). Now we shall be all right, my dear, till our
      Harry comes home to-morrow. (<i>Affected gurgling laugh</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie (<i>Distracted</i>). Be quiet. Shut yourself in. You will make me
      mad. (<i>Losing control of herself, repeats with rising infection</i>) You
      make me mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>With despair</i>) There is no to-morrow! (<i>Sinks to ground near
      middle railings. Low sobs</i>)

      What! What do you say, my dear? No to-morrow? (<i>Broken, very feebly</i>.)

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
